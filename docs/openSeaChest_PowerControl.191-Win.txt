Welcome to the openSeaChest open source project!

This collection of storage device utility software is branched (forked) off of
an original utility collection called the Seagate SeaChest Utilities by Seagate
Technology LLC.  The original SeaChest Utilities are still available at
www.seagate.com or https://github.com/Seagate/ToolBin/tree/master/SeaChest.
Binary versions are available for Linux or Windows, with the Windows versions
signed by Seagate Technology LLC.

BINARIES and SOURCE CODE files of the openSeaChest open source project have
been made available to you under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL).  The
openSeaChest project repository is maintained at

This User Guide file contains important information about openSeaChest
PowerControl.  Please read this entire file before using this software.

openSeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your storage product. It
includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your storage
device.

Many tests and commands are completely data safe, while others will change the
drive (like firmware download or data erasure or setting the maximum capacity,
etc).  Be careful using openSeaChest because some of the features, like the
data erasure options, will cause data loss.   Some commands, like setting the
maximum LBA, may cause existing data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some
commands, like disabling the read look ahead buffer, may affect the performance
of the drive.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

openSeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for
expert users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about
running software from the operating system command prompt. CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  openSeaChest diagnostics are available for both
Linux and Windows environments.

Welcome to Seagate's openSeaChest_PowerControl diagnostic software.

Optimization within the framework of a complex company data center requires
dynamic technology. As storage capacity demands increase due to virtualization
and growing volumes of data, managing power usage in an intelligent way is
critical for reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

There are, roughly, three general frameworks for disk drive power management.
The earlier specification is part of Advanced Power Management (APM) which
provided controls over many devices in a system, including disk drives.  APM
has since been replaced by a new framework called Extended Power Controls
(EPC).  Seagate's implementation of EPC began to phase in starting in 2010 and
is named by the marketing term "PowerChoice".  Seagate PowerChoice
technology—specifically developed for enterprise environments—offers more
energy efficiency and control over the amount of power hard drives consume.

You may need to learn what capabilities for power management your drive offers,
such as supporting APM or EPC, and maybe both.  See the commands
--showEPCSettings or --showAPMLevel(SATA Only) or --deviceInfo for various
reports containing power settings and features supported.  Most enterprise
drives after 2016 only support EPC (PowerChoice).

PowerChoice technology improves on earlier technology and allows for
energy-saving during periods of command inactivity, allowing for greater power
reductions. As idle time increases, the power-saving benefits also increase,
and the drives will still quickly respond to commands even after long idling
periods. In addition, PowerChoice technology supports four customizable modes
to give businesses significantly more control of power usage by allowing for up
to a 54% reduction in the amount of energy used.

See the section below "How PowerChoice Technology Works"

The third and newest drive power management framework exists for SATA drives
and is named PowerBalance.  Seagate's PowerBalance feature will adjust drive
performance during random operations to reduce power consumption of the drive.

openSeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the status of your storage product.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
openSeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Note: One gigabyte, or GB, equals one billion bytes when referring to hard
drive capacity. This software may use information provided by the operating
system to display capacity and volume size. The Windows file system uses a
binary calculation for gibibyte or GiB (2^30) which causes the abbreviated size
to appear smaller. The total number of bytes on a disk drive divided by the
decimal calculation for gigabyte or GB (10^9) shows the expected abbreviated
size. See this FAQ for more information
<http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/172191en?language=en_US>.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Usage
=====
        openSeaChest_PowerControl [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        openSeaChest_PowerControl --scan
        openSeaChest_PowerControl -d PD0 -i
        openSeaChest_PowerControl -d PD1 --deviceInfo

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the PD physical device handle (target drive) on which to
                perform an operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints'
                for information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge. To see the child drive
                details add --usbChildInfo to the command line options.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --checkPowerMode
                Get the current power mode of a drive. On SCSI devices, this
                will only work if the drive has transitioned from active state
                to another state.  In Windows, the --checkPowerMode command
                will always wake up SATA drives which are controlled by the
                default Microsoft drivers.  This means you cannot check the
                power mode and determine that it is in Idle or Standby. Drives
                on secondary controllers or non-Microsoft device drivers may
                accept the --checkPowerMode command without waking up the drive.

        --spinDown
                Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby
                Immediate for SATA, or standby_z for SAS. Use this before
                moving a hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the
                operating system selects the drive. This means that an active
                drive will not stay spun down.

        --idle
                This command will transition a drive to the idle power state.
                This command may flush the cache before the transition to this
                state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If the
                drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that the
                --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition. If the operating system selects
                this drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --idleUnload
                This command will transition a drive to the idle, heads
                unloaded, power state. This command may flush the cache before
                the transition to this state.  This command is for non-EPC
                enabled drives.  If the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it
                is recommended that the --transitionPower option be used
                instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as
                well, but offers less control over the transition. If the
                operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back
                to an active state.

        --standby
                This command will transition a drive to the standby power
                state.  This command will flush the cache before the transition
                to this state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If
                the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that
                the --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition.  On an HDD, this will cause the
                spindle motor to stop.  If the operating system selects this
                drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --active
                This command will transition a drive to the active power state.
                This uses a ATA read-verify command to a random LBA, or a SCSI
                start-stop unit command.

        --showEPCSettings
                Use this option to show the current Extended Power Conditions
                (EPC) settings on the screen. Only drives supporting the EPC
                feature will show this data and only supported power conditions
                will be shown.

        --EPCfeature [enable | disable]
                Enables or disables Extended Power Conditions (EPC) support for
                devices.  To disable EPC use --EPCfeature disable. Note that the
                EPC Feature Set is not supported on all devices. Use
                --deviceInfo option to see if EPC is supported.

        --changePower
                Use this option to enable or disable certain --powerMode and
                their timers. You can also use this option to restore default
                values to the drive. The available power modes are idle_a,
                idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only), standby_z, or all. "all"
                can only be used to enable/disable/default everything. It
                cannot be used to set a timer. Timer values are specified in
                milliseconds.

                Example restore: --changePower --defaultMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example enable: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example set timer: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                                   --modeTimer 5000

        --enableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to enable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --modeTimer [timer value in milliseconds]
                Use this option to specify a timer value to use with the
                --changePower mode option.

        --disableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to disable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --defaultMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to restore
                the default settings for a specific --powerMode.  The "all"
                option is only valid for SAS interface drives.

        --transitionPower
                Use this option to actively change --powerMode. The available
                power modes are idle_a, idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only),
                standby_z, or active (SAS only).

                Note: Hard disk drives require a few seconds time to spin up or
                down. The drive will report the old power mode until it is
                fully established in the new mode.  The openSeaChest --spinDown
                command is similar.  On SAS --spinDown is equivalent to Motor
                Stop and --transitionPower --powerMode active is equivalent to
                Motor Start.

                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode idle_a
                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode standby_y

        --powerMode [powermode]
                Use this option to specify a power mode. This should be used
                with the --changePower or --transitionPower options.
                Valid power modes (SAS and SATA):
                        idle_a
                        idle_b
                        idle_c
                        standby_y (SAS only)
                        standby_z
                        active (SAS only, used with --trasitionPower)
                        all (used with --changePower enable, disable or default)
                Valid power modes (NVMe): 0 - 30

        --showPowerConsumption  (SAS Only)
                This option will show the power consumption rates supported by
                the device and the current power consumption rate of the
                device. Use a supported watt value with the
                --setPowerConsumption option to set the power consumption to
                that value.

        --setPowerConsumption [default | highest | intermediate | lowest |
          watt value]   (SAS Only)
                This option will set the power consumption rate of the device
                to the value input.
                Options:
                        default - sets the device back to default settings
                        highest - sets the active level to "highest"
                        intermediate - sets the active level to "intermediate"
                        lowest - sets the active level to "lowest"
                        watt value - sets the device to a nearest watt value
                           less than or equal to the value entered.

                Power consumption watt values are listed with the
                --showPowerConsumption command line option.

        --showAPMLevel   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to show the current Advanced Power Management
                (APM) level of a device

        --setAPMLevel [1 - 254]   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to set the APM level of a device. Valid values
                are between 1 and 254.  This setting is non-volatile so it
                holds across power cycles.
                      1 = Minimum power consumption with standby mode
                  2-127 = Intermediate power management with standby mode
                    128 = Minimum power consumption without standby mode
                129-253 = Intermediate power management without standby mode
                    254 = Maximum Performance

        --disableAPM   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable the current Advanced Power Management
                (APM) level of a device

        --powerBalanceFeature [ info | enable | disable ]   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to see the state of the Seagate PowerBalance
                feature or to change its state. Seagate's PowerBalance feature
                will adjust drive performance during random operations to
                reduce power consumption of the drive.
                    info - will display the state of the PowerBalance feature
                           on the screen
                    enable - use this to enable PowerBalance
                    disable - use this to disable PowerBalance
                Note: SAS products should use the --setPowerConsumption option
                instead.

        --sataDAPSfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Automatic
                Partial To Slumber Transitions (DAPS) feature. Use the "info"
                option to see the current state of the DIPM feature on the
                device. The use of this feature requires that the DIPM feature
                is enabled.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

        --sataDIPMfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Initiated
                Power Management (DIPM) feature. Use the "info" option to see
                the current state of the DIPM feature on the device.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the openSeaChest_PowerControl -s option to determine what physical device
assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other
details about the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the physical device handle (-d, --device).

For example, openSeaChest -d PD2 --spinDown

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
openSeaChest_PowerControl -d PD1 -i --spinDown runs both identify and spin down.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d PD# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then openSeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

================================
How PowerChoice Technology Works
================================
See the Seagate technology paper "Seagate® PowerChoice™ Technology Provides
Unprecedented Hard Drive Power Savings and Flexibility"
http://www.seagate.com/files/docs/pdf/en-GB/whitepaper/tp608-powerchoice-tech-provides-gb.pdf

Each individual power condition builds on the capabilities of the previous
higher power condition in order to save incrementally more power. The specific
energy-saving steps implemented for each power condition are as follows:

Idle_A
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_B
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_C/Standby_Y (SAS Only)
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive speed reduced to a lower RPM (reduced RPM)
Standby_Z
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive motor is spun down.
        - Drive still responds to non-media access host commands.

Flexibility is a key feature of PowerChoice technology, enabling commands from
the host side to customize power condition settings and direct a drive into or
out of power conditions as required. Two different options are available for
the user to modify PowerChoice technology settings, depending on the interface
used:

SAS
        Host-definable timers via mode pages
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Start/Stop Unit (SSU)
        command
SATA
        Host-definable timers via Set Features commands
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Set Features commands

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\openSeaChest_PowerControl --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual openSeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just
clicking on the file name. If started that way, the openSeaChest utility will
briefly show a black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when
trying to run it from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the openSeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

About openSeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
===========================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

openSeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for
expert users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about
running software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in
the English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the
various tasks and specific devices.  openSeaChest diagnostics are available for
both Linux and Windows environments.

Linux versions of openSeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of
openSeaChest diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can
be removed via the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB openSeaChest flash
drive which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows
executable file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over
all the files needed to use it as a bootable device for the openSeaChest
diagnostic software. All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure
to protect any valuable files.

Technical Support for openSeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you
have the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you
notice something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing
from you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

openSeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

openSeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other openSeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which
offer more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

openSeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

openSeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

openSeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the
latest firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.
Seagate recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or
reliability of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates
within the early life of the product.

openSeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

openSeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic
which is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool
offers several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.
In addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

openSeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written
and power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

openSeaChest PowerControl - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

openSeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

openSeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
