Welcome to the openSeaChest open source project!

This collection of storage device utility software is branched (forked) off of
an original utility collection called the Seagate SeaChest Utilities by Seagate
Technology LLC.  The original SeaChest Utilities are still available at
www.seagate.com or https://github.com/Seagate/ToolBin/tree/master/SeaChest.
Binary versions are available for Linux or Windows, with the Windows versions
signed by Seagate Technology LLC.

BINARIES and SOURCE CODE files of the openSeaChest open source project have
been made available to you under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL).  The
openSeaChest project repository is maintained at
https://github.com/Seagate/openSeaChest.

This User Guide file contains important information about openSeaChest Info.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

openSeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your storage product. It
includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your storage
device.

Many tests and commands are completely data safe, while others will change the
drive (like firmware download or data erasure or setting the maximum capacity,
etc).  Be careful using openSeaChest because some of the features, like the
data erasure options, will cause data loss.   Some commands, like setting the
maximum LBA, may cause existing data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some
commands, like disabling the read look ahead buffer, may affect the performance
of the drive.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

openSeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for
expert users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about
running software from the operating system command prompt. CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  openSeaChest diagnostics are available for both
Linux and Windows environments.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Note: One gigabyte, or GB, equals one billion bytes when referring to hard
drive capacity. This software may use information provided by the operating
system to display capacity and volume size. The Windows file system uses a
binary calculation for gibibyte or GiB (2^30) which causes the abbreviated size
to appear smaller. The total number of bytes on a disk drive divided by the
decimal calculation for gigabyte or GB (10^9) shows the expected abbreviated
size. See this FAQ for more information

Usage - Linux (run with sudo)
=============================
        openSeaChest_Security [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        sudo openSeaChest_Security --scan
        sudo openSeaChest_Security -d /dev/sg2 -i

Usage - Windows (run as administrator)
======================================
        openSeaChest_Security [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        openSeaChest_Security --scan
        openSeaChest_Security -d PD0 -i

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
                /dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
                numbers. If your device is not listed on a scan immediately
                after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

       -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     nvme           - show only NVMe devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                     interfaceNVME  - show devices on a NVMe interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        SATA Only
        =========
        --ataSATsecurityProtocol [enable | disable]         (SATA only)
                This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
                ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification. By
                default, the tool will use this method when it is supported to
                allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
                being performed and prevent other issues.

                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If a drive
                lost power during an ATA Security Erase in SeaChest, then using
                the password SeaChest with type 'user' will remove the temporary
                password set by the utility.

                Example:
                --ataSATsecurityProtocol disable --ataSecPassword SeaChest --ataSecPassType user

                Some commands like --scan and --deviceInfo will still run on a
                locked drive. To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS
                must have set the password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash
                the password typed in the configuration however it chooses and
                this utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so
                it may not always work to remove a password set by something
                other than this utility. See the --ataSecPWMod command below
                for additional alternatives.

        --ataSecPassword ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]      (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA
                security operation. If specifying a password with spaces,
                quotes must be used. If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest
                password will be used. If empty is given, an empty password
                will be used.

                Examples:
                  "This is a valid password"
                  ThisIsAlsoValid
                  "This password uses \"quotes\"
                  "This password is \/\/eird"

                Note: Windows PE offers an ATA Security Erase feature. If the
                erase is interrupted then a temporary password
                AutoATAWindowsString12345678901 is still set.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --ataSecPassType [user | master]                (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
                --ataSecPassword option is a user or a master password. If this
                option is not provided, user is assumed.

        --ataSecPWMod [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign |
          rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
                Use this option to have the utility make modifications to the
                ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may be
                sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
                may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
                the password in a unique way. This option can be presented
                multiple times to select multiple modifications.

                EX: --ataSecPWMod byteswapped --ataSecPWMod invertcase
                  byteswapped - byteswaps the password. EX: blah -> lbha
                  zeropad - zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  spacepad - space pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  fpad - pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than
                     32characters
                  leftAlign - left aligns the password in the buffer
                  rightAlign - right aligns the password in the buffer
                  uppercase - sends the password as all uppercase
                  lowercase - sends the password as all lowercase
                  invertcase - switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for
                  upper

        --ataSecFreeze          (SATA only)
                This option will send the ATA security freezelock command to a
                device. This command prevents all other ATA security commands
                from being processed until the next reset or power cycle.

        --ataSecurityInfo               (SATA only)
                This option shows information about the ATA security feature on
                ATA devices. It will show the security state and flags related
                to the state, Master password capability & ID, time to perform
                a secure erase, whether user data is encrypted, and whether
                sanitize can override ATA security to repurpose a drive.

        --disableATASecPW               (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If the
                drive is in high security mode, either user or master password
                may be provided. In maximum security mode only the user
                password can be provided to unlock and disable the ATA security
                password. The master may only be used to erase the drive in
                maximum security mode. Use the --ataSecPassword option to
                provide the password to use and --ataSecPassType to specify
                whether it is the user or master password.

                If a drive lost power during an ATA Security Erase in
                SeaChest_Security, then providing --ataSecPassword SeaChest
                will use the default SeaChest password used during the erase.
                To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS must have set the
                password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash or modify the
                password typed in the configuration however it chooses and this
                utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so it
                may not always work to remove a password set by something other
                than this utility.

        --unlockATASec          (SATA only)
                Use this option along with the --ataSecPassword option and
                --ataSecPassType option to unlock a drive with the provided
                password.  If the drive is in maximum security mode, only the
                user password may be used to unlock the device.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run openSeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show openSeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the openSeaChest -s option to determine what /dev/sg? or PD? device
handle assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you
other details about the drive including the current firmware revision.

Linux:
Vendor     Handle       Model Number       Serial Number     FwRev
ATA        /dev/sg0     ST94813AS          3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    /dev/sg1     ST1000NM0011       ZAA15VAS          SN03

Windows:

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg or PD device handle (-d, --device).

Lin example, openSeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST poll
Win example, openSeaChest_Basics -d PD2 --shortDST poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
inLinux, openSeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and
SMART.  In Windows, openSeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both
identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example, in Linux,
openSeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two
devices.  In Windows, openSeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on
these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

If the task is an OFFLINE command like format unit or short DST, meaning that
the drive works on the task in the background and the tool quickly returns to
the command prompt (there is little or no I/O to the system), then you can
expect the system to run normally. If the task has high I/O to the system like
a sequential read of all sectors on the drive, then you can expect the system
to slow down with each additional device.

The discussion above is about starting SEQUENTIAL tests, or one after the
other.  When the task does not return to the command prompt for a very long
time, then you have a few options to run tests in PARALLEL, also called
simultaneous, in other words all at the same time.  One way is to start
different drives in different Terminal windows, if available.  There are other
more sophisticated methods using parallel processing, for information about
these methods please see the information at this link:
https://github.com/Seagate/ToolBin/tree/master/SeaChest/parallel_testing

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to -I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time or
-I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

Windows Only Usage
==================
All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then openSeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

When drives are reported Security "Frozen" by openSeaChest
------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Your system or the openSeaChest software may report that a SATA password
cannot be changed because it is "frozen". Many systems BIOS will automatically
set the ATA SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command on all SATA drives at start up. The
SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command prevents changes to all Security states until a
following power-on reset or hardware reset. The purpose of the SECURITY FREEZE
LOCK command is to prevent password setting attacks on the security system.

The openSeaChest --deviceInfo command will display something similar to this: "ATA
Security Information: Supported, Frozen". To disable Freeze Lock, first check
your BIOS SATA disk options to control the setting at start up. Otherwise, you
might pause the boot up shortly after powering on the system and then
temporarily remove the power to the security frozen drive (let it completely
spin down). When the power is back on the drive it will start without being
frozen.

Windows systems may also decide not to recognize the drive if it is ATA
Security Locked and it will not be listed by the openSeaChest --scan command.  If
the drive remains undetected in Windows, your alternative is to make a bootable
USB flash drive and run SeaChest_Erase from the Linux operating system.

=========================
Linux General Usage Hints
=========================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./openSeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll
or, sudo ./openSeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
openSeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with openSeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the openSeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./openSeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST poll

When drives are not detected by openSeaChest
--------------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by
openSeaChest to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. openSeaChest tools should
then be able to find devices once again.

How to control the amount of runtime kernel messages
----------------------------------------------------
When testing more drives than a system can hold, careful use of host adapters
and hot-plugging batches of drives (but never to direct motherboard
connections!) can help speed the process.  The Linux operating system will
display various system error messages, or none, when storage devices are
powered down and exchanged with the next drives.  The amount of information
contained in the OS error messages can be reviewed using the Linux utility
command "sysctl kernel.printk".  The default setting is defined by the
particular distro.  Tiny Core Linux, for example may set "4 4 1 7".  To hide
hot-plugging messages try "3 4 1 7", to increase the messaging to include
device details like model numbers try "6 4 1 7".  The command to set is 'sudo
sysctl -w kernel.printk="6 4 1 7"'.  See man sysctl - "configure kernel
parameters at runtime" for more.

Tesing storage devices on the USB and Thunderbolt interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when testing a storage device, it is more convenient to attach it as
an external drive to the test system. In the case of SATA drives there are very
many SATA-to-USB 'bridge' adapters available.  The quality and range of command
'passthrough' support for these adapters varies greatly.  Our tools will
attempt to work through these adapters.

If your notebook has a Thunderbolt interface connection then you may be able to
test a wide range of devices.  External Thunderbolt expansion systems provide a
PCIe slot in a chassis that can hold a SAS, NVMe, or SATA host adapter. The
host adapters would have cables that go out to your test bench where you would
provide the drive and an external power supply for the drives. Thunderbolt 2
expansion systems work in Linux by default. Thunderbolt 3 expansion systems
need to be enabled in the kernel with boot time options before it will be
recognized by the Linux operating system. See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/thunderbolt.html for
information about how to activate the interface.

===========================
Windows General Usage Hints
===========================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\openSeaChest --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual openSeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just
clicking on the file name. If started that way, the openSeaChest utility will
briefly show a black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when
trying to run it from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the openSeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

About openSeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
===========================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

openSeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for
expert users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about
running software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in
the English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the
various tasks and specific devices.  openSeaChest diagnostics are available for
both Linux and Windows environments.

Linux versions of openSeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of
openSeaChest diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can
be removed via the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB openSeaChest flash
drive which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows
executable file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over
all the files needed to use it as a bootable device for the openSeaChest
diagnostic software. All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure
to protect any valuable files.

Technical Support for openSeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you
have the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you
notice something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing
from you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

openSeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

openSeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other openSeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which
offer more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

openSeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

openSeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

openSeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the
latest firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.
Seagate recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or
reliability of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates
within the early life of the product.

openSeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

openSeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic
which is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool
offers several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.
In addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

openSeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written
and power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

openSeaChest PowerControl - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

openSeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

openSeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.
