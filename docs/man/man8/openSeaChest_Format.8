Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-formatUnit\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [format]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress format"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-showSupportedSectorSizes\fR
.IP
This option will show the supported sector sizes of a device if
it reports them. These can be used to change the sector size or
used with a format unit operation.
On SAS, this is the supported block lengths and protection types
VPD page. (SBC4 and later)
On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4 and later)
If the device does not report supported sector
sizes, please consult your product manual.
.PP
SAS Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-showFormatStatusLog\fR (SAS Only)

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only)
.br
========================================
.HP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]
.IP
Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs
or the whole drive.
.IP
* repeat \- without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This
pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size
of the LBA. i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be given
for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or 0000FFFFh
.br
* random \- the entire logical sector size will be filled with
random bytes.This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
desired range.
.br
* increment \- enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.
* file \- user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector size
.br
Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
.br
Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
local directory.
.br
Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for
SATA products.
.TP
\fB\-\-setSectorSize\fR [new sector size]
.IP
This option is only available for drives that support sector
size changes. On SATA Drives, the set sector configuration
command must be supported. On SAS Drives, fast format must
be supported. A format unit can be used instead of this
option to perform a long format and adjust sector size.
Use the \fB\-\-showSupportedSectorSizes\fR option to see the sector
sizes the drive reports supporting. If this option
doesn't list anything, please consult your product manual.
This option should be used to quickly change between 5xxe and
4xxx sector sizes. Using this option to change from 512 to 520
or similar is not recommended at this time due to limited drive
support
.PP
SAS Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-disableCertification\fR
.IP
Use this option to disable the certification operation
when performing a format unit operation.
.HP
\fB\-\-disablePrimaryList\fR
.IP
Use this option to disable using the primary defect list
when performing a format unit operation.
.HP
\fB\-\-discardGList\fR
.IP
Use this option to discard the existing grown defect list
when performing a format unit operation. (set complete list bit)
.HP
\fB\-\-disableImmediateResponse\fR
.IP
Use this option to disable the immediate response bit in
a format unit operation.
Note: This mode may take a long time to complete.
.HP
\fB\-\-formatMaxLBA\fR
.IP
Use this option to specify a new Max LBA for a drive during a
format unit operation. This can speed up a format unit if
formatting to test something, or also desiring to reduce a drive's
capacity while formattting.
.HP
\fB\-\-protectionIntervalExponent\fR [ exponent value ]
.IP
Use this option to specify the protection interval exponent
for protection types 2 & 3. This option is ignored for all
other protection types.
.HP
\fB\-\-protectionType\fR [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
.IP
Use this option to specify the protection type to format the
medium with.
Note: Not all devices support protection types.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastFormat\fR [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
.IP
Use this option with the \fB\-\-formatUnit\fR option
to run a fast format.
Available fast format modes:
.IP
0 \- This is a standard format unit command. All logical
blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
very long time
.br
1 \- This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
data in physical sector. This option can be used to
quickly change the the logical sector size between
5xxe and 4xxx. The media may be readable, but data
may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
according to it's error processing algorithms.
.br
2 \- This is a fast format unit command that can change the
logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
read accessible until a write has been performed to
the media.
.TP
\fB\-\-formatUnit\fR [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only)
.IP
This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
size to use upon format completion. This command will erase all
data on the drive. Combine this option with \fB\-\-poll\fR to poll
for progress until the format is complete.
.HP
\fB\-\-securityInitialize\fR
.IP
Use this option to set the security initialize bit in the
initialization pattern for a format unit command.
SBC recommends migrating to sanitize to overwrite previously
reallocated sectors.
Note: Not all products support this option.
.HP
\fB\-\-stopOnListError\fR
.IP
Use this option to set the stop format bit in a format unit.
If the device cannot locate or access an existing primary or
grown defect list, the format will stop and return with an error.
