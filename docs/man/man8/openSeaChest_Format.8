Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side

until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
.TP
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
.TP
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [format | nvmformat | depop | repop]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR

using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-depopulateMaxLBA\fR [requested MaxLBA]
.IP
Use this option to specify a new maximum LBA when
removing (depopulating) a physical storage element.
This is optional. If this is not specified, the device
will determine the new maximum LBA.
NOTE: If you specify a maximum LBA the device does not
support, it will not start the depopulation.
.HP
\fB\-\-showPhysicalElementStatus\fR
.IP
Use this option to see the status/health of
the storage elements inside a drive.
Use the element # shown with the \fB\-\-removePhysicalElement\fR
option to remove that storage element from use.
This option can also be used to see if a depopulation
is still in progress or if it has completed.
.HP
\fB\-\-showSupportedFormats\fR
.IP
This option will show the supported formats of a device.
These can be used to change the sector size or
used with a format operation. On SAS, this is the
supported block lengths and protection types VPD page. (SBC4
and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4
and later) If the device does not report supported sector
sizes, please consult your product manual.
.TP
WARNING: Customer unique firmware may have specific requirements that
restrict sector sizes on some products. It may not be possible to format/
fast format to common sizes like 4K or 512B due to these customer requirements.
.IP

Data Destructive Commands
=========================
.HP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]
.IP
Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs
or the whole drive.
.IP
* repeat \- without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This
pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size
of the LBA. i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be given
for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or 0000FFFFh
* random \- the entire logical sector size will be filled with
random bytes.This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
desired range.
* increment \- enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.
* file \- user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector size
Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
.IP
local directory.
.TP
Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for
SATA products.
.HP
\fB\-\-removePhysicalElement\fR [element #]
.IP
Use this option to remove a storage element
from use on a drive. When this is done, the
drive will erase all user data and lower the
capacity to a new point where the drive is still
usable without the provided element #.
Use the \fB\-\-showPhysicalElementStatus\fR option to see the status
of the depopulation operation.

\fB\-\-setSectorSize\fR [new sector size]
.IP
Changing sector sizes is intended for supported Seagate products
used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please consult your
hardware RAID documentation for information about compatibility and
using 4K native sectors before using this option!
Software RAID or individual/JBOD drive solutions will see no benefit as modern
file systems and modern operating systems are already 4K aware even on
512 emulation drives. Modern operating systems already align file systems to 4K
boundaries required by these drives for optimal performance.
Performing a sector size change is data destructive and has a risk that
the adapter, driver, or operating system may not know how to communicate with
the device once this has completed.
