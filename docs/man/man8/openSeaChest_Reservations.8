.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP

Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP

.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceNVME\fR

Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR

using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
