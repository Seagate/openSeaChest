Utility Options
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceNVME\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a NVME drive. Only NVME commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP

.IP
Use this option to suppress the text banner that displays each time
openSeaChest is run.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlyFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP

Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-ptDriveHint\fR [ata | nvme]
.IP
This option passes a hint to the software that the device being tested is
an ATA or NVMe drive so it can appropriately test it.
This option is most useful when also using \fB\-\-ptTypeHint\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-ptTypeHint\fR [sat | legacyATA]
.IP
Add this option if the device being tested is likely to support one of
the supported passthrough types. This hints to the software to perform
additional testing for these passthroughs if no other support is apparent.
.TP
sat \- device supports SAT ATA\-passthrough commands (12 or 16 byte)
legacyATA \- device supports a legacy vendor unique method to passthrough
.TP
ATA commands. You must also specify \fB\-\-enableLegacyATAPTTest\fR
in order for these commands to be tested.
.HP
\fB\-\-disablePassthroughTesting\fR
.IP
Disables all ATA passthrough testing. Device will only be tested with SCSI commands from
SPC and SBC specifications.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyATAPTTest\fR
.IP
Add this option to the command line to allow sending legacy passthrough CDBs from
old USB adapters or drivers. By default these are off since these operation codes
may perform unintended actions on devices that don't actually support passthrough.
For example: There is a USB thumbdrive that receives one of these and bricks immediately.
Only add this to the command line if you understand and have high confidence that the
device you are testing is likely to support one of these passthroughs. Most of these devices
will have been created prior to 2006 when the SAT spec was added for a standardized passthrough.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableHangCmdsTest\fR [all | zlr | sctgpl | rrTdir]
.IP
There are some commands that are known to cause some translators
to hang when they are received. This option covers some known commands for some devices
This must be enabled manually for a more complete test, but if it hangs the device could cause problems.
Each of these tests has a specific hack/quirk related to it, so if the device hangs, then it must be added
to the list for higher compatibility. Not all hangs will be able to be detected by the software!
Put this option on the command line multiple times to add different combinations of tests.
.TP
all \- run all known commands that may cause hangs
zlr \- do SCSI read commands with zero transfer length
sctgpl \- try reading the SCT status log with a GPL read log ext command
rrTdir \- in the SAT return response information protocol, run it without setting the tdir bit as the spec allows
.HP
\fB\-\-forceRetest\fR
.IP
Use this option to force this utility to retest this device if it reports
that it is already known. This may be useful when testing multiple devices
that use the same chip and are identified, or when trying to troubleshoot
compatibility on another OS.
.HP
\fB\-\-runPTTest\fR
.IP
This option is used to perform the passthrough test.
The passthrough test is an attempt to figure out quirks or
hacks with different translators in order to make the device
more compatible with the rest of the openSeaChest software.
The default test is done using only what can be determined about
the device from the SCSI reported data. Attempting to passthrough
ATA or NVMe commands may not be done depending on how the device reports.
Using the other options can help tell this software to test for other
behavior. The other options to control the test are as follows:
.TP
\fB\-\-ptDriveHint\fR
\fB\-\-ptTypeHint\fR
\fB\-\-disablePassthroughTesting\fR
\fB\-\-enableLegacyATAPTTest\fR
\fB\-\-enableHangCmdsTest\fR
\fB\-\-forceRetest\fR
