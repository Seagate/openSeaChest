Utility Options
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceNVME\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a NVME drive. Only NVME commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)
Please report bugs/suggestions to seaboard@seagate.com.

Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).
.HP
\fB\-\-modelMatch\fR [model Number]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
model number. This option will provide a closest match although
an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001
.HP
\fB\-\-noBanner\fR
.IP
Use this option to suppress the text banner that displays each time
openSeaChest is run.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlyFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlySeagate\fR
.IP
Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
provided

.IP
Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are:
0 \- quiet
1 \- default
2 \- command descriptions
3 \- command descriptions and values
4 \- command descriptions, values, and data buffers
Example: \fB\-v\fR 3 or \fB\-\-verbose\fR 3

.PP
Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-closeZone\fR
.IP
Use this option to close a zone specified with the \fB\-\-zoneID\fR option
.HP
\fB\-\-finishZone\fR
.IP
Use this option to finish a zone specified with the \fB\-\-zoneID\fR option
.HP
\fB\-\-maxZones\fR [count]
.IP
Use this option to set a maximum number of zones to display with
the \fB\-\-reportZones\fR option.
.HP
\fB\-\-openZone\fR
.IP
Use this option to open a zone specified with the \fB\-\-zoneID\fR option
.HP
\fB\-\-reportZones\fR [all | empty | implicitOpen | explicitOpen | closed |
.IP
full | readOnly | offline | resetRecommended | nonSeqResourceAvailable | allNonWP]
.IP
Use this option to display the zones of a specific type, where they start,
the length of the zones, and where the write pointer is at.
Combine this option with \fB\-\-zoneID\fR and \fB\-\-maxZones\fR
To show a different list/subset of the zones on the drive.
Ex: \fB\-\-reportZones\fR empty \fB\-\-zoneID\fR 123456 \fB\-\-maxZones\fR 30
*all \- show all zones
*empty \- show only empty zones
*implicitOpen \- show only implicitly opened zones
*explicitOpen \- show only explicitly opened zones
*closed \- show only closed zones
*full \- show only full zones
*readOnly \- show only read only zones
*offline \- show only offline zones
*resetRecommended \- show only zones that have the reset recommended bit set
*nonSeqResourceAvailable \- show only zones with a non sequential access resource available
*allNonWP \- show all non\-write pointer zones.
.HP
\fB\-\-resetWritePointer\fR
.IP
Use this option to reset a write pointer at the zone specified with the \fB\-\-zoneID\fR option
.HP
\fB\-\-zoneID\fR [LBA/zone ID | all]
.IP
Use this option to specify a zone ID for use with other options
such as \fB\-\-reportZones\fR, \fB\-\-closeZone\fR, \fB\-\-finishZone\fR, \fB\-\-openZone\fR, \fB\-\-resetWritePointer\fR.              A zone ID is an LBA at the start of a specified zone.
Use "all" with the options listed above to apply an action
to all zones on the device.
