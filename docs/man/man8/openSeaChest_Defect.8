Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-errorLimit\fR [limit in number of LBAs]
.IP
Use this option to specify a different error
limit for a user generic or long generic read
test or DST and Clean. This must be a number of
.IP
logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple
logical sectors per physical sector, this number will
.IP
be adjusted for you to reflect the drive
architecture.
.HP
\fB\-\-checkGrownListCount\fR [count to check]
.IP
Use this option to check if the grown defect list count is
greater than the provided value.
.HP
\fB\-\-checkPendingListCount\fR [count to check]
.IP
Use this option to check if the pending defect list count is
greater than the provided value.
NOTE: This only works on SAS products that support the Pending
Defects log page from SBC4 or later
.HP
\fB\-\-showPendingList\fR (Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to show the pending defect list
as it is reported by the drive.
NOTE: SBC4 pending log required for SAS support.
.IP
SAS Only:
.HP
\fB\-\-defectFormat\fR [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS Only)
.IP

longBlock  | 3 \- show the defects in long block address mode (drives > 32bit LBA)
bfi        | 4 \- show the defects in bytes from index mode
chs        | 5 \- show the defects in physical cylinder\-head\-sector mode
.TP
\fB\-\-showSCSIDefects\fR [ p | g | pg ]
(SAS Only)
.IP
This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.
The arguments to this will tell whether to get the grown,
primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.
Use the \fB\-\-defectFormat\fR option to specify the mode to display the defects.
If no mode is specified, physical cylinder\-head\-sector mode is assumed
Arguments:
.IP
p \- use this option to pull and display the primary (factory) defects
g \- use this option to pull and display the grown (reallocated) defects
.IP
The above options can be combined to pull and display both defect lists.
.PP
Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only)
========================================
.TP
\fB\-\-bytesToCorrupt\fR [# of bytes]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the number of data bytes to change
when used with the \fB\-\-corruptLBA\fR option.
.HP
\fB\-\-dstAndClean\fR
.IP
Runs DST, then checks for an error and repairs the
error if possible. This continues until all errors
reported by DST are fixed, or when the error limit is
reached. The default limit is 50 errors.
.TP
\fB\-\-corruptLBA\fR [lba]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to corrupt the data bytes of an LBA. The
\fB\-\-bytesToCorrupt\fR option can be used to specify the number of bytes to
corrupt. If that option is not given, a default will be used
that attempts to create a correctable error on the drive.
This option can be used to create uncorrectable or correctable
errors on a drive, depending on it's ECC algorithm and the number
of corrupted data bytes.
.TP
\fB\-\-corruptRandomLBAs\fR [# of LBAs to corrupt]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
This option will corrupt the specified number of LBAs randomly
on the device. The \fB\-\-bytesToCorrupt\fR option can be used to specify the number of bytes to
corrupt. If that option is not given, a default will be used
that attempts to create a correctable error on the drive.
This option can be used to create uncorrectable or correctable
errors on a drive, depending on it's ECC algorithm and the number
of corrupted data bytes.
.TP
\fB\-\-corruptRange\fR [# of LBAs]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
This option is used with the \fB\-\-corruptLBA\fR option to
corrupt a range of LBAs on the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-disableReadUncorrectables\fR
.IP
Use this option to disable issuing read commands to the LBAs
where errors are written. This option should only be used for
debugging. When this option is used, the uncorrectable errors
may not end up being logged in the Pending Defect List on the
drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-flaggedUncorrectable\fR
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to flag an uncorrectable error instead of
creating a pseudo uncorrectable error with the
\fB\-\-psuedoUncorrectable\fR or \fB\-\-randomUncorrectables\fR options.
Error types:
.TP
Pseudo \- creates a pseudo uncorrectable error. The device
will perform full error recovery and logging on failure.
.TP
Flagged \- flags an error. The device will not perform error
recovery and will not log on failure.
.TP
\fB\-\-psuedoUncorrectable\fR [lba]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to create a uncorrectable error at
the specified LBA. Use \fB\-\-uncorrectableRange\fR to specify a range.
By default, pseudo uncorrectable errors will be created for
the entire physical sector. Use the \fB\-\-flaggedUncorrectable\fR option
to flag errors instead. Flagged errors do not get logged
or have any error processing when encountered.
.TP
\fB\-\-randomUncorrectables\fR [number of errors]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to create a number of random uncorrectable
LBAs on a drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-uncorrectableRange\fR [range]
(Seagate Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify a range of LBAs to create an
uncorrectable error at. This option must be used with the
\fB\-\-psuedoUncorrectable\fR or \fB\-\-flaggedUncorrectable\fR options so that a
starting LBA is specified.
