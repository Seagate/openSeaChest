Usage
.br
=====
.IP
openSeaChest_Info [\-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}
.PP
Examples
.br
========
.IP
openSeaChest_Info \fB\-\-scan\fR
.br
openSeaChest_Info \fB\-d\fR /dev/sg? \fB\-i\fR
.PP
Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
.br
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-deviceStatistics\fR
.IP
Use this option to display the device statistics reported
by the device. On SATA, this uses the Device Statistics
log, and the notifications log (if DSN feature is supported)
to display these statistics. On SAS, various log pages are
read to collect a bunch of reported parameter information.
.PP
SATA Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-smartAttributes\fR [raw | analyzed]      (SATA Only)
.IP
The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
used to determine a warranty return. Use the \fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
attributes.
.PP
SAS Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-defectFormat\fR [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS Only)
.IP
This option set the format of the defects to output.
Not all drives will support all defect modes!
SSDs will only support block modes!
.IP
Arguments: (name | #)
.IP
shortBlock | 0 \- show the defects in short block address mode (drives < 32bit LBA)
.br
xbfi       | 1 \- show the defects in extended bytes from index mode.br
.br
xchs       | 2 \- show the defects in extended physical cylinder\-head\-sector mode
.br
longBlock  | 3 \- show the defects in long block address mode (drives > 32bit LBA)
.br
bfi        | 4 \- show the defects in bytes from index mode
.br
chs        | 5 \- show the defects in physical cylinder\-head\-sector mode
.TP
\fB\-\-showSCSIDefects\fR [ p | g | pg ]    (SAS Only)
.IP
This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen.
The arguments to this will tell whether to get the grown,
primary, or primary and grown defects from the drive.
Use the \fB\-\-defectFormat\fR option to specify the mode to display the defects.
If no mode is specified, physical cylinder\-head\-sector mode is assumed
.br
Arguments:
.IP
p \- use this option to pull and display the primary (factory) defects
.br
g \- use this option to pull and display the grown (reallocated) defects
.IP
The above options can be combined to pull and display both defect lists.
.PP
Utility Options
.br
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.
.HP
\fB\-\-enableLegacyUSBPassthrough\fR
.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATADMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAPIO\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO
commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR    (SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-forceSCSI\fR
.IP
Using this option will force the current drive to
be treated as a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will
be used to talk to the drive.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)
Please report bugs/suggestions to seaboard@seagate.com.
Include the output of \fB\-\-version\fR information in the email.
.HP
\fB\-\-license\fR
.IP
Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).
.HP
\fB\-\-modelMatch\fR [model Number]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
model number. This option will provide a closest match although
an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001
.HP
\fB\-\-onlyFW\fR [firmware revision]
.IP
Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
.HP
\fB\-\-onlySeagate\fR
.IP
Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
provided
.HP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.IP
Run openSeaChest_Info in quiet mode. This is the same as
\fB\-v\fR 0 or \fB\-\-verbose\fR 0
.HP
\fB\-\-sat12byte\fR
.IP
This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec
ATA Pass\-through 12 byte commands when possible instead
of 16 byte commands. By default, 16 byte commands are
always used for ATA Pass\-through.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR [0\-4], \fB\-\-verbose\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
.IP
Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are:
.br
0 \- quiet
.br
1 \- default
.br
2 \- command descriptions
.br
3 \- command descriptions and values
.br
4 \- command descriptions, values, and data buffers
.br
Example: \fB\-v\fR 3 or \fB\-\-verbose\fR 3
