Utility arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-zeroVerify\fR [full | quick]
.IP
Use this option to verify drive content, whether it's set to zero or not.
This operation will read user accessible address and validate if content at
that address is zero or not.
Validation modes:
.IP
full \- Complete drive will be scanned for verification.
quick \- 0.1% of total capacity will be scanned for ID and OD validation along with
.IP
2 random addresses from 10000 equal size sections each.
.IP
SATA Only:
=========
\fB\-\-ataSATsecurityProtocol\fR [enable | disable]             (SATA only)
.IP
This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification.
By default, the tool will use this method when it is supported
to allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
being performed and prevent other issues.
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecFreeze\fR
(SATA only)
.IP
This option will send the ATA security freezelock command to
a device. This command prevents all other ATA security commands
from being processed until the next reset or power cycle.
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]
(SATA only)
.IP
Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA security
operation. If specifying a password with spaces, quotes must be used.
If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest password will be used.
If empty is given, an empty password will be used.
Examples:
.IP
"This is a valid password"
ThisIsAlsoValid
"This password uses \e"quotes\e"
"This password is \e/\e/eird"
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecPassType\fR [user | master]
(SATA only)
.IP
Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
\fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR option is a user or a master password.
If this option is not provided, user is assumed.
.HP
\fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign | rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to have the utility make modifications to
the ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may
be sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
the password in a unique way.
This option can be presented multiple times to select multiple modificaitons.
EX: \fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR byteswapped \fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR invertcase
.IP
byteswapped \- byteswaps the password. EX: blah \-> lbha
zeropad \- zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
spacepad \- space pads the password if less than 32 characters
fpad \- pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than 32characters
leftAlign \- left aligns the password in the buffer
rightAlign \- right aligns the password in the buffer
uppercase \- sends the password as all uppercase
lowercase \- sends the password as all lowercase
invertcase \- switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for upper
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecurityInfo\fR
(SATA only)
.IP
This option shows information about the ATA security
feature on ATA devices. It will show the security state and
flags related to the state, Master password capability & ID,
time to perform a secure erase, whether user data is encrypted,
and whether sanitize can override ATA security to repurpose a drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-disableATASecPW\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to disable an ATA security password.
If the drive is in high security mode, either user or
master password may be provided. In maximum security mode
only the user password can be provided to unlock and disable the
ATA security password. The master may only be used to erase the drive
in maximum security mode.
Use the \fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR option to provide the password to use and
\fB\-\-ataSecPassType\fR to specify whether it is the user or master password.
If a drive lost power during an ATA Security Erase in
openSeaChest_Security, then providing \fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR SeaChest
will use the default SeaChest password used during the erase.
.IP
To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS must have set the
.IP
password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash or modify the
password typed in the configuration however it
chooses and this utility has no idea how to match what
the BIOS has done so it may not always work to remove
a password set by something other than this utility.
.TP
\fB\-\-unlockATASec\fR
(SATA only)
.IP
Use this option along with the \fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR option and
\fB\-\-ataSecPassType\fR option to unlock a drive with the provided password.
If the drive is in maximum security mode, only the user password
may be used to unlock the device.
.PP
Data Destructive Commands (Seagate only)
========================================
.IP
SATA Only:
=========
\fB\-\-ataSecureErase\fR [normal | enhanced]    (SATA only)     (Clear | Purge)
.IP
Use "normal" to start a standard ATA security erase (Clear)
or "enhanced" to start an enhanced ATA security erase (Purge).
.IP
ATA Security Erase takes a very long time to complete at
approximately three (3) hours per Tera\-byte (HDD). Some Seagate
SED models will perform a quick cryptographic erase in enhanced
mode and the time for completion is reported as 2 minutes by
the drive, but will take only seconds. This industry
standard command begins by locking the drive with a temporary
password which is cleared at the end of the erasure. Do not run
this command unless you have ample time to allow it to run
through to the end. If the procedure is interrupted prior to
completion, then the drive will remain in a locked state and
you must manually restart from the beginning again. The
tool will attempt to automatically clear the password that was set
upon failure. The default password used by the tool is
"SeaChest", plain ASCII letters without the quotes
.IP
* normal writes binary zeros (0) or ones (1) to all user
data areas.
.IP
* enhanced will fill all user data areas and reallocated
user data with a vendor specific pattern. Some Seagate
Instant Secure Erase will perform a cryptographic
erase instead of an overwrite.
