that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR

commands to ATA device using the protocol set to DMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR

commands to ATA device when possible. This option can
be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-forceATAUDMA\fR
(SATA Only)
.IP
Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT
commands to ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA
whenever possible (on DMA commands).
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-forceATA\fR

Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP

numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.

using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR

status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.

to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-dataDir\fR [in | out | none]

raw command, the returned error data will not be
saved to a file to prevent adding unexpected data
to the created file.

\fB\-\-tfrByteBlock\fR [512 | logical | bytes | nodata] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the data transfer length
being sent or received when issuing a raw SATA command. This option must match
the definition of the command in the ATA/ACS specification.
This option must be provided before a command will be sent.
Arguments:
.IP
512 \- the data transfer is a number of 512B blocks (most commands)
logical \- data transfer is a number of logical block sizes transfers (read commands)
bytes \- the data transfer is a specific number of bytes (some legacy commands or tpsiu is used)
nodata \- no data transfer. Used on non\-data protocol commands
.IP
NOTE: All read/write commands should use "logical", all other data transfers should use 512
.HP
\fB\-\-tfrProtocol\fR [pio | dma | udma | fpdma | ncq | nodata | reset | dmaque | diag] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the protocol for

of the command in the ATA/ACS specification.
This option must be provided before a command will be sent.
Arguments:
.IP
pio \- send as programmed IO protocol.
dma \- send as direct memory access protocol
udma \- send as ultra direct memory access protocol
fpdma/ncq \- send as first party direct memory access protocol (NCQ)
nodata \- send as non\-data protocol
reset \- send as reset protocol (ATAPI only)
dmaque \- send as direct memory access queued protocol (TCQ)
diag \- send as devie diagnostic protocol
.IP
NOTE: If a command with dma doesn't work, try udma. Some SATLs like it better.
NOTE: Most SATLs don't allow sending queued commands as pass\-through. Some OSs
.IP
also will not allow queued pass\-through commands.
.HP
\fB\-\-tfrSetChkCond\fR (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to set the check condition bit in the SAT CDB that may be
sent to a translator to inform it to generate a check condition and return
all task file results.
NOTE: This option may not work on all SATLs.
.TP
\fB\-\-tfrSize\fR [28 | 48 | complete]
(SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the command type: 28bit or 48bit
when issuing a raw SATA command. This option must match
the definition of the command in the ATA/ACS specification.
This option must be provided before a command will be sent.
Arguments:
.IP
28 \- the command is a 28 bit command (ex: identify, SMART)
48 \- the command is a 48 bit command (ex: read DMA ext, read log ext)
complete \- 48 bit command that also sets ICC or AUX registers.
.TP
use this to force a 32B CDB. If specifying 48 and AUX or ICC
are set, 32B CDB will automatically be generated without needing
this option explicitly set.
.TP
NOTE: complete TFR requires SAT 32B cdb, which many devices or interfaces
may not support. These commands may not be available.
.TP
\fB\-\-tfrXferLengthReg\fR [sectorCount | feature | tpsiu | nodata]
(SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the registers used to specify the length of data
being sent or received when issuing a raw SATA command. This option must match
the definition of the command in the ATA/ACS specification.
This option must be provided before a command will be sent.
Arguments:
.IP
sectorCount \- the sector count registers specify the number of blocks (most commands)
feature \- the feature registers specify the number of blocks (queued commands)
tpsiu \- a transport specific location will specify the length of the data transfer
nodata \- no data transfer. Used on non\-data protocol commands
.TP
NOTE: tpsiu is generally only seen supported on USB adapters, but not all USB SATL's
will recognize this option.
.TP
NOTE: For commands, such as identify (ECh), that transfer data, but do not specify
a value of 1 in the sector count, it is recommended that this is added
to the sector count register and and "sectorCount" is used for better
compatibility with various SATLs.
.IP
SAS Only:
=========
\fB\-\-cdb\fR [csv CDB]
.IP
Use this option to specify a specific CDB to
send to a device. The entered value must be
in comma separated value (csv) format. To
specify a value as hex, it must be either
pre\-pended with "0x" or post\-pended with
"h" or "H"
Examples:
.TP
1) inquiry: \fB\-\-cdb\fR 12h,0,0,0,60h,0
2) inquiry: \fB\-\-cdb\fR 0x12,0,0,0,0x60,0
3) inquiry: \fB\-\-cdb\fR 18,0,0,0,96,0
.IP
All 3 examples send the same command to a drive
.HP
\fB\-\-cdbLen\fR [length in bytes]
.IP
Use this option to specify the length of the CDB
to send to the device. Max length is 255
Some OS's may not support CDBs larger than 16 bytes
