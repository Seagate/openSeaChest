Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
.TP
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
.TP
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [sanitize | format | nvmformat]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-hours\fR [hours]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in hours
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-minutes\fR [minutes]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in minutes
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-seconds\fR [seconds]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in seconds
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-eraseRestoreMaxPrep\fR
.IP
This option will attempt to restore the max LBA to the highest
user addressable sector prior to beginning a drive erasure.
If any failure is encountered while restoring the maxLBA, then
an error will be indicated and the erase will not be started or
attempted until other user intervention can be completed.
If a feature is frozen, locked, or has already been used during
the current power cycle, then these things can cause a failure.
The solution is to power cycle the drive, but in some cases it may
be necessary to try a different computer or adapter as commands may
be blocked by the system or automatically issued by the BIOS to lock
access to capacity changing commands.
This option will handle the ATA HPA (Host Protected Area), AMAC (Accessible
Max Address Configuration), HPA Security Extension, and DCO (Device
Configuration Overlay) features in accordance with the specifications.
If the restore completes without error, then the erase will proceed
and additional errors will only be in relation to those erasure methods.
.HP
\fB\-\-showEraseSupport\fR
.IP
This option checks the drive to determine which methods of
data erasure are supported and lists them, from fastest to
slowest.
.TP
WARNING: Some erase methods may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-zeroVerify\fR [full | quick]
.IP
Use this option to verify drive content, whether it's set to zero or not.
This operation will read user accessible address and validate if content at
that address is zero or not.
Validation modes:
.IP
full \- Complete drive will be scanned for verification.
quick \- 0.1% of total capacity will be scanned for ID and OD validation along with
.IP
2 random addresses from 10000 equal size sections each.
.IP
SATA Only:
=========
\fB\-\-ataSATsecurityProtocol\fR [enable | disable]             (SATA only)
.IP
This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification.
By default, the tool will use this method when it is supported
to allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
being performed and prevent other issues.
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]
(SATA only)
.IP
Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA security
operation. If specifying a password with spaces, quotes must be used.
If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest password will be used.
If empty is given, an empty password will be used.
Examples:
.IP
"This is a valid password"
ThisIsAlsoValid
"This password uses \e"quotes\e"
"This password is \e/\e/eird"
.TP
\fB\-\-ataSecPassType\fR [user | master]
(SATA only)
.IP
Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
\fB\-\-ataSecPassword\fR option is a user or a master password.
If this option is not provided, user is assumed.
.HP
\fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign | rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
.IP
Use this option to have the utility make modifications to
the ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may
be sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
the password in a unique way.
This option can be presented multiple times to select multiple modificaitons.
EX: \fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR byteswapped \fB\-\-ataSecPWMod\fR invertcase
.IP
byteswapped \- byteswaps the password. EX: blah \-> lbha
zeropad \- zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
spacepad \- space pads the password if less than 32 characters
fpad \- pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than 32characters
leftAlign \- left aligns the password in the buffer
rightAlign \- right aligns the password in the buffer
uppercase \- sends the password as all uppercase
lowercase \- sends the password as all lowercase
invertcase \- switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for upper
.PP
Data Destructive Commands
=========================
Data sanitization capabilities:
.TP
Recommendation \- Restore the MaxLBA of the device prior to any erase in
order to allow the drive to erase all user addressable
sectors. For ATA devices this means restoring
HPA + DCO / AMAC to restore the maxLBA.
Restoring the MaxLBA also allows full verification of
all user addressable space on the device without a
limitation from a lower maxLBA.
.IP
Clear \- Logical techniques are applied to all addressable storage
.IP
locations, protecting against simple, non\-invasive data
recovery techniques.
.IP
Clear, Possible Purge \- Cryptographic erase is a purge if the vendor
.IP
implementation meets the requirements in IEEE 2883\-2022.
.IP
Purge \- Logical techniques that target user data, overprovisioning,
.IP
unused space, and bad blocks rendering data recovery infeasible
even with state\-of\-the\-art laboratory techniques.
.PP
This utility does not support clear/purge verification yet. All labels are
written according to the expectation that the device firmware will meet
these capabilities as defined in the appropriate standards from T10, T13,
SATA \- IO, and NVMexpress.
=========================
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\fR [starting LBA]
(Clear)
.IP
Use this option to start an overwrite erase at
the specified starting LBA. Combine this option
with overwriteRange or time options (hours, minutes
seconds) to erase a portion of the drive.
.TP
\fB\-\-overwriteRange\fR [range in # of LBAs]
(Clear)
.IP
Use with the overwrite option (\fB\-\-overwrite\fR) to
erase a range of LBAs on the selected drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]
.IP
Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs
or the whole drive.
.IP
* repeat \- without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This
pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size
of the LBA. i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be given
for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or 0000FFFFh
* random \- the entire logical sector size will be filled with
random bytes.This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
desired range.
* increment \- enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.
* file \- user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector size
Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
.IP
local directory.
.TP
Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for
SATA products.
.HP
\fB\-\-performQuickestErase\fR
.IP
This option checks the drive to determine which methods of
data erasure are supported and determines which is the
quickest to erase ALL data on the drive. It then starts the
quickest erase. Combine this option with the \fB\-\-poll\fR option to
enable polling for progress on the fastest erase.
Note: Some erase methods require polling and will have polling
enabled by default.
Note 2: If revertSP is the fastest, it will not be started since
the drive PSID must be passed in on the command line.
.TP
WARNING: Some erase methods may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.TP
\fB\-\-sanitize\fR [info | blockerase | cryptoerase |
overwrite | freezelock | antifreezelock]    (Purge)
.IP
Use the info argument to show supported sanitize operations.
Optionally, use blockerase, cryptoerase, or overwrite to start
a sanitize operation. Adding the \fB\-\-poll\fR option will cause
openSeaChest_Erase to poll the drive for progress until the
operation is complete, or has aborted for some reason. All
sanitize erase operations are persistent across a power cycle
and cannot be stopped
Example: \fB\-\-sanitize\fR blockerase \fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
* blockerase on some solid state drives is very fast at less
than one (1) second, while others may take more that 30 seconds
This operation performs a physical low level block erase
operation on all current, past, and potential user data.
The contents on user data are indeterminate upon completion.
.IP
* cryptoerase is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
data causing all previous data to be useless.
.IP
* overwrite is a physical overwrite on all current, past, and
potential user data. The ATA and SCSI specifications allow a
user defined pattern and multiple passes. openSeaChest_Erase will
use a zero pattern and a single pass for this operation.
.IP
* freezelock is a command to block processing of sanitize
operations until a power cycle is performed on a device.
It is only available on ATA drives. Once this command has been
sent, the freezelock status becomes immediate and cannot be
cleared until the drive has been powered off. All sanitize
commands, except a sanitize status will be aborted.
.IP
* antifreezelock is a command that is designed to block a
freezelock command from locking out the sanitize feature set.
It is only available on ATA drives that support the ACS3, or
newer specification.
.TP
WARNING: Sanitize may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-trim\fR or \fB\-\-unmap\fR [starting LBA]
.IP
Use one of these options to start a trim or
unmap operation on a drive at the provided LBA.
A range must also be provided with the range option.
.HP
\fB\-\-trimRange\fR or \fB\-\-unmapRange\fR [range in # of LBAs]
.IP
Use one of these options to specify a range to trim
or unmap on a drive. A starting point must be specified
with the \fB\-\-trim\fR/\-\-unmapRange option.
.TP
\fB\-\-writeSame\fR [starting LBA]
(Clear)
.IP
Enter a starting lba to begin a write same on to erase a range
of data on the drive. On SCSI devices, this uses the
writesame16 command. On ATA devices, this uses the SCT writesame
feature. Combine this option with the writeSameRange option to
select the range. This operation will write 0's to the device for the
specified range. For SATA drives, this option will poll for progress
until the write same has completed. SAS/SCSI drives will hold the
tool busy until the write same has completed without progress
indication since this is not possible on SAS/SCSI due to specification
limitations on how write same was defined.
On SATA, if any other commands are sent to the drive while it's
performing a write same, the write same will be aborted.
NOTE: On SAS/SCSI drives this command is optional. Additionally,
.TP
the range may be limited to much less than the full device
size. Due to the history of this command, there is not a great
way to confirm support in all cases. Some ranges will be too
large, and some devices may or may not allow writing the full
medium in a single command. If you wish to write an entire
device, consider a different command such as format unit or
sanitize overwrite to accomplish this.
.HP
\fB\-\-writeSameRange\fR [range in # of LBAs]
.IP
Specify a range to writesame to. Use this option with the
writeSame option in order to begin a write same operation.
.IP
SATA Only:
=========
\fB\-\-ataSecureErase\fR [normal | enhanced]    (SATA only)     (Clear | Purge)
.IP
Use "normal" to start a standard ATA security erase (Clear)
or "enhanced" to start an enhanced ATA security erase (Purge).
.IP
ATA Security Erase takes a very long time to complete at
approximately three (3) hours per Tera\-byte (HDD). Some Seagate
SED models will perform a quick cryptographic erase in enhanced
mode and the time for completion is reported as 2 minutes by
the drive, but will take only seconds. This industry
standard command begins by locking the drive with a temporary
password which is cleared at the end of the erasure. Do not run
this command unless you have ample time to allow it to run
through to the end. If the procedure is interrupted prior to
completion, then the drive will remain in a locked state and
you must manually restart from the beginning again. The
tool will attempt to automatically clear the password that was set
upon failure. The default password used by the tool is
"SeaChest", plain ASCII letters without the quotes
.IP
* normal writes binary zeros (0) or ones (1) to all user
data areas.
.IP
* enhanced will fill all user data areas and reallocated
user data with a vendor specific pattern. Some Seagate
Instant Secure Erase will perform a cryptographic
erase instead of an overwrite.
.IP
SAS Only:
=========
\fB\-\-fastFormat\fR [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
.IP
Use this option with the \fB\-\-formatUnit\fR option
to run a fast format.
Changing sector sizes is intended for supported Seagate products
used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please consult your
hardware RAID documentation for information about compatibility and
using 4K native sectors before using this option!
Software RAID or individual/JBOD drive solutions will see no benefit as modern
file systems and modern operating systems are already 4K aware even on
512 emulation drives. Modern operating systems already align file systems to 4K
boundaries required by these drives for optimal performance.
Performing a sector size change is data destructive and has a risk that
the adapter, driver, or operating system may not know how to communicate with
the device once this has completed.
.PP
[49m[38;5;9m          There is an additional risk when performing a low\-level fast format that may
.IP
make the drive inoperable if it is reset at any time while it is formatting.
.SS "[0m            Available fast format modes:"
.TP
0 \- This is a standard format unit command. All logical
blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
very long time
.TP
1 \- This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
data in physical sector. This option can be used to
quickly change the the logical sector size between
5xxe and 4xxx. The media may be readable, but data
may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
according to it's error processing algorithms.
.TP
2 \- This is a fast format unit command that can change the
logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
read accessible until a write has been performed to
the media.
.PP
[49m[38;5;11m         WARNING: Any interruption to the device while it is formatting may render the

drive inoperable! Use this at your own risk!
.TP
WARNING: Set sector size may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.TP
WARNING: Disable any out\-of\-band management systems/services/daemons
before using this option. Interruptions can be caused by these
and may prevent completion of a sector size change.
.TP
WARNING: It is recommended that this operation is done from a bootable environment
(Live USB) to reduce the risk of OS background activities running and
triggering a device reset while reformating the drive.
.PP
[0m    \fB\-\-formatUnit\fR [current | new sector size]        (SAS Only)      (Clear)
.IP
This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
size to use upon format completion. This command will erase all
data on the drive. Combine this option with \fB\-\-poll\fR to poll

Changing sector sizes is intended for supported Seagate products
used in some hardware RAID configurations. Please consult your
hardware RAID documentation for information about compatibility and
supported/required sector sizes!

WARNING: Format Unit may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.TP
WARNING: Customer unique firmware may have specific requirements that
restrict sector sizes on some products. It may not be possible to format/
fast format to common sizes like 4K or 512B due to these customer requirements.

NVMe Only:
=========
\fB\-\-nvmFmtMetadataSet\fR [ xlba | separate ] (NVMe Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify how metadata is transmitted to
the host system.
Options:
.IP
xlba \- metadata is transferred as part of the logical block data
separate \- metadata is transferred as a separate buffer
.IP
Note: Not all devices support specifying this.
If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
reuse the current setting.
.TP
\fB\-\-nvmFmtMS\fR [ # of bytes for metadata ]
(NVMe Only)
.IP
This option is used to specify the length of metadata
with a requested logical block size. The device must
support the combination of logical block size and metadata size
or the format will be rejected by the device.
.TP
\fB\-\-nvmFmtNSID\fR [all | current]
(NVMe Only)
.IP
This option changes the NSID used when issuing the NVM format
command. This can be used to control formatting an entire
device or a specific namespace if the device supports specifying
specific namespaces for a format command. Not all devices support
this behavior. This has no effect on devices that do not support
targeting a specific namespace and will format the entire device
If this option is not given, the format will be issued to all
namespaces by default.
.TP
\fB\-\-nvmFmtPI\fR [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
(NVMe Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the protection type to format the
medium with.
Note: Not all devices support protection types.
If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
reuse the current setting.
.HP
\fB\-\-nvmFmtPIL\fR [ beginning | end ] (NVMe Only)
.IP
Use this option to specify the location protection
information in an NVM device's metadata.
Note: Not all devices support specifying this.
If this option is not provided, the NVM format will
reuse the current setting.
.TP
\fB\-\-nvmFmtSecErase\fR [none | user | crypto] (NVMe Only)
(None | Clear | Clear, Possible Purge)
.IP
This option is used to specify the type of erase to perform
during an NVM format operation. All user data will be inaccessible
upon completion of an NVM format, no matter the erase requested.
Options:
.TP
none \- no secure erase requested (previous data will not be accessible,
however the media may not have been erased by the controller.)
.IP
user \- requests all user data is erased by the device. (Clear)
crypto \- requests a cryptographic erase of all user data. Note: this mode
.IP
is not supported on all devices. (Clear, Possible Purge)
.TP
\fB\-\-nvmFormat\fR [current | format # | sector size]
(NVMe Only)
.IP
This option is used to start an NVM format operation.
Use "current" to perform a format operation with the
Sector size currently being used.
If a value between 0 and 15 is given, then that will issue
the NVM format with the specified sector size/metadata size for
that supported format on the drive.
Values 512 and higher will be treated as a new sector size
to switch to and will be matched to an appropriate lba format
supported by the drive.
This command will erase all data on the drive.
Combine this option with\-\-poll to poll
for progress until the format is complete.
A data sanitization compliant with IEEE 2883 Clear requires the \fB\-\-nvmFmtSecErase\fR
option to be provided. Without this option the controller
may not erase all user data and substitute returning zeroes
for performance instead.
