Utility Arguments
.br
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR deviceHandle
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg?
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.IP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
.br
usb \- show only USB devices
.br
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
.br
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
.br
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
.br
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
.br
.br
sd \- show sd device handles
.br
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [sanitize, format]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-hours\fR [hours]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in hours
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-minutes\fR [minutes]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in minutes
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-seconds\fR [seconds]
.IP
Use this option to specify a time in seconds
for a timed operation to run.
.HP
\fB\-\-showEraseSupport\fR
.IP
This option checks the drive to determine which methods of
data erasure are supported and lists them, from fastest to
slowest.
.HP
\fB\-\-showPhysicalElementStatus\fR
.IP
Use this option to see the status/health of
the storage elements inside a drive.
Use the element # shown with the \fB\-\-removePhysicalElement\fR
option to remove that storage element from use.
This option can also be used to see if a depopulation
is still in progress or if it has completed.
.PP
SATA Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-disableATASecurityPW\fR [SeaChest | ASCIIPW] [user | master]
.IP
Use this option to disable an ATA security password.
If a drive lost power during an ATA Security Erase in
openSeaChest_Erase, then using the option "SeaChest" will remove
the password used by the utility. To disable a
password set by a BIOS, the BIOS must have set the
password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash the
password typed in the configuration however it
chooses and this utility has no idea how to match what
the BIOS has done so it may not always work to remove
a password set by something other than this utility.
.PP
Utility Options
.br
===============
.HP
\fB\-\-echoCommandLine\fR
.IP
Echo the command line entered into the utility on the screen.

.IP
Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire)
products that do not otherwise work with the tool.
This option will enable a trial and error method that
attempts sending various ATA Identify commands through
vendor specific means. Because of this, certain products
that may respond in unintended ways since they may interpret
these commands differently than the bridge chip the command
was designed for.
.HP
\fB\-\-forceATA\fR

.PP
Data Destructive Commands    (Seagate only)
.br
========================================
.HP
\fB\-\-overwrite\fR [starting LBA]
.IP
Use this option to start an overwrite erase at
the specified starting LBA. Combine this option
with overwriteRange or time options (hours, minutes
seconds) to erase a portion of the drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-overwriteRange\fR [range]
.IP
Use with option with the overwrite option to
erase a range of LBAs on the selected drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue | file:filename]
.IP
Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs
or the whole drive.
.IP
* repeat \- without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This
pattern will be repeated until it fills the logical size
of the LBA. i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be given
for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or 0000FFFFh
.br
* random \- the entire logical sector size will be filled with
random bytes.This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
desired range.
.br
* increment \- enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.
.br
* file \- user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector size
.br
Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
.br
Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
local directory.
.br
Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit pattern.
The file option will get truncated to a 32bit pattern for
SATA products.
.HP
\fB\-\-performQuickestErase\fR
.IP
This option checks the drive to determine which methods of
data erasure are supported and determines which is the
quickest to erase ALL data on the drive. It then starts the
quickest erase. Combine this option with the \fB\-\-poll\fR option to
enable polling for progress on the fastest erase.
.br
Note: Some erase methods require polling and will have polling
enabled by default.
.HP
\fB\-\-removePhysicalElement\fR [element #]
.IP
Use this option to remove a storage element
from use on a drive. When this is done, the
drive will erase all user data and lower the
capacity to a new point where the drive is still
usable without the provided element #.
Use the \fB\-\-showPhysicalElementStatus\fR option to see the status
of the depopulation operation.
.TP
\fB\-\-sanitize\fR [info | blockerase | cryptoerase |
overwrite | freezelock | antifreezelock]
.IP
Use the info argument to show suported sanitize operations.
Optionally, use blockerase, cryptoerase, or overwrite to start
a sanitize operation. Adding the \fB\-\-poll\fR option will cause
openSeaChest_Erase to poll the drive for progress until the
operation is complete, or has aborted for some reason. All
sanitize erase operations are persistent across a power cycle
and cannot be stopped
.br
Example: \fB\-\-sanitize\fR blockerase \fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
* blockerase on some solid state drives is very fast at less
than one (1) second, while others may take more that 30 seconds
This operation performs a physical low level block erase
operation on all current, past, and potential user data.
The contents on user data are indeterminate upon completion. Consider
using the \fB\-\-poll\fR option to monitor % completion.
.br
* cryptoerase is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
data causing all previous data to be useless.
.br
* overwrite is a physical overwrite on all current, past, and
potential user data. The ATA and SCSI specifications allow a
user defined pattern and multiple passes. openSeaChest_Erase will
use a zero pattern and a single pass for this operation.
.br
* freezelock is a command to block processing of sanitize
operations until a power cycle is performed on a device.
It is only available on ATA drives. Once this command has been
sent, the freezelock status becomes immediate and cannot be
cleared until the drive has been powered off. All sanitize
commands, except a sanitize status will be aborted.
.br
* antifreezelock is a command that is designed to block a
freezelock command from locking out the sanitize feature set.
It is only available on ATA drives that support the ACS3, or
newer specification.
.HP
\fB\-\-trim\fR or \fB\-\-unmap\fR [starting LBA]
.IP
Use one of these options to start a trim or
unmap operation on a drive at the provided LBA.
A range must also be provided with the range option.
.HP
\fB\-\-trimRange\fR or \fB\-\-unmapRange\fR [range]
.IP
Use one of these options to specify a range to trim
or unmap on a drive. A starting point must be specified
with the \fB\-\-trim\fR/\-\-unmap option.
.HP
\fB\-\-writeSame\fR [starting LBA]
.IP
Enter a starting lba to begin a write same on to erase a range
of data on the drive. On SCSI devices, this uses the
writesame16 command. On ATA devices, this uses the SCT writesame
feature. Combine this option with the writeSameRange option to
select the range. This operation will write 0's to the device for the
specified range. For SATA drives, adding the \fB\-\-poll\fR option will
cause this operation to poll for progress until complete. This
is not available on SAS and SCSI drives because SCSI drives do not
report the progress on a Write Same operation.
On SATA, if any other commands are sent to the drive while it's
performing a write same, the write same will be aborted.
.HP
\fB\-\-writeSameRange\fR [range]
.IP
Specify a range to writesame to. Use this option with the
writeSame option in order to begin a write same operation.
.PP
SATA Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-secureErase\fR [normal | enhanced]               (SATA only)
.IP
Use "normal" to start a standard ATA security erase
or "enhanced" to start an enhanced ATA security erase.
.IP
ATA Security Erase takes a very long time to complete at
approximately three (3) hours per Terabyte (HDD). Some Seagate
SED models will perform a quick cryptographic erase in enhanced
mode and the time for completion is reported as 2 minutes by
the drive, but will take only seconds. This industry
standard command begins by locking the drive with a temporary
password which is cleared at the end of the erasure. Do not run
this command unless you have ample time to allow it to run
through to the end. If the procedure is interrupted prior to
completion, then the drive will remain in a locked state and
you must manually restart from the beginning again. The
password to unlock the drive is "SeaChest", plain ASCII
letters without the quotes
.IP
* normal writes binary zeroes (0) or ones (1) to all user
data areas.
.br
* enhanced will fill all user data areas and reallocated
user data with a vendor specific pattern. Some Seagate
Instant Secure Erase will perform a cryptographic
erase instead of an overwrite.
.PP
SAS Only:
.br
=========
.br
\fB\-\-fastFormat\fR [fast format mode]    (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
.IP
Use this option with the \fB\-\-formatUnit\fR option
to run a fast format.
Available fast format modes:
.IP
0 \- This is a standard format unit command. All logical
blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
very long time
.br
1 \- This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
data in physical sector. This option can be used to
quickly change the the logical sector size between
5xxe and 4xxx. The media may be readable, but data
may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
according to it's error processing algorithms.
.br
2 \- This is a fast format unit command that can change the
logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
read accessible until a write has been performed to
the media.
.TP
\fB\-\-formatUnit\fR [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only)
.IP
This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
size to use upon format completion. This command will erase all
data on the drive. Combine this option with \fB\-\-poll\fR to poll
for progress until the format is complete.
