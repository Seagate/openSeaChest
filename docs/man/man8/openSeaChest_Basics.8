Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-checkPowerMode\fR
.IP
Get the current power mode of a drive.
On SCSI devices, this will only work if the drive has
transitioned from active state to another state.
.HP
\fB\-\-displayLBA\fR [LBA]
.IP
This option will read and display the contents of
the specified LBA to the screen. The display format
is hexadecimal with an ASCII translation on the side
(when available).
.HP
\fB\-\-activateFW\fR
.IP
Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
immediately activate the new code on the drive.
You can use this along with a \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR & \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR to
automatically issue the activate command after the download has
completed.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware activation may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-downloadFW\fR [firmware_filename]
.IP
Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
device manufacturer authorized firmware data files which are designated
for the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may
harm a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without
spaces) if the firmware data file is in a different location.
This option will use segmented download by default. Use the
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR option to specify a different download mode.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces
for devices with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR [ auto | full | segmented | deferred | deferred+activate ]
.IP
Use this option along with the \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR option
to set the firmware download mode.
Supported Modes:
.TP
auto \- automatically determines the best mode to use to
perform the firmware update.
.TP
full \- performs a download in one large
transfer to the device.
.TP
segmented \- downloads the firmware in multiple
segments to the device. (Most compatible)
.TP
deferred \- performs a segmented download to the
device, but does not activate the new
firmware until a powercycle or activate
command is sent.
.TP
deferred+activate \- performs a deferred download and
automatically acitvates it for you.
Similar to how a segmented download works
but uses a separate activate command. This
is the recommended mode that "auto" will
select when possible for maximum compatibility
with Windows 10 and later operating systems.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware Updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-showLockedRegions\fR
.IP
This option should only be used when performing firmware
updates on legacy products. What this does is it ignores
a failing error code from the OS on the final segment of a
firmware update, but this update is actually successful.
This is needed to workaround hardware or firmware limitations
that were present in some old products.
.HP
\fB\-\-shortDST\fR
.IP
Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
up to 2 minutes to complete. Use the \fB\-\-poll\fR argument to make
this operation poll for progress until complete. Use the
\fB\-\-progress\fR dst command to check on the completion percentage
(%) and test result.
NOTE: Short DST may take longer if there is other disk usage
while the DST is running. If the DST takes longer than 10 minutes
it will automatically be aborted while polling for progress.
To override this behavior, use the \fB\-\-noTimeLimit\fR option.
.HP
\fB\-\-poll\fR
.IP
Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
.TP
the final test result.
Full drive procedures will take a
.TP
very long time.
Used with \fB\-\-sanitize\fR, or \fB\-\-writeSame\fR (SATA).
.HP
\fB\-\-progress\fR [dst]
.IP
Get the progress for a test that was started quietly without
the polling option (default). You must specify a test you wish to
get progress from. Ex: "\-\-progress dst" or "\-\-progress sanitize"
The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.
.HP
\fB\-\-abortDST\fR
.IP
Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.
.HP
\fB\-\-phySpeed\fR [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5]
.IP
Use this option to change the PHY speed to a
new maximum value. On SAS, this option will
set all phys to the specified speed unless the
\fB\-\-sasPhy\fR option is given to select a specific phy.
0 \- allow full negotiation (default drive behavior)
1 \- allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s
2 \- allow negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s
3 \- allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s
4 \- allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s (SAS Only)
5 \- allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)
.IP

.TP
WARNING: Check the minimum phy speed supported by your adapter before
using this option. A phy speed below the adapter's capability
will result in the drive not being seen by the adapter or the OS.
.TP
WARNING: Changing Phy speed may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-readLookAhead\fR [info | enable | disable]
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable read look\-ahead
support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
the current status of the read look ahead feature.
.TP
WARNING: Changing Read look\-ahead may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-restoreMaxLBA\fR
.IP
Restore the max accessible address of your drive to its native
size. A power cycle is required after this command before
setting a new max LBA.
.HP
\fB\-\-setMaxLBA\fR newMaxLBA
.IP
Set the max accessible address of your drive to any value less
than the device's default native size. A power cycle is
required after this command before resetting or setting a new
max LBA.
.HP
\fB\-\-showConcurrentRanges\fR
.IP
Use this option to display the concurrent positioning ranges
supported by a device. Concurrent positioning ranges are used
to inform which actuator is used for a given range in LBA space.
.HP
\fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
.IP
Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal
thresholds have been tripped or if the drive is still operating
within specification.
.HP
\fB\-\-spinDown\fR
.IP
Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby Immediate
command. Use this before moving a hard disk drive. The drive
will spin back up if the operating system selects the drive.
This means that an active drive will not stay spun down.
.TP
WARNING: Spindown may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-writeCache\fR [info | enable | disable]
.IP
Use this option to enable or disable write cache
support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
the current status of the write cache feature.

.IP
SATA Only:
=========
\fB\-\-smartAttributes\fR [raw | hybrid | analyzed]     (SATA Only)
.IP
The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
used to determine a warranty return. Use the \fB\-\-smartCheck\fR
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
attributes.
Output modes:
.IP
raw \- All hex output for those that need every single bit.
hybrid \- classic table view with some interpretation of some
.TP
fields. Partial raw interpretation, but not all drive
and firmware combinations are supported.
