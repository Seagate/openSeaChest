\fB\-\-setSCSIMP\fR [ mp[\-sp]:byte:highestBit:fieldWidthInBits=value | file=filename.txt ]
(SAS only)
.IP
Use this option to set a specific field in a mode page to a value.
There are two argument formats to this option:
1. The first format expects a mode page (in hex), optionally a subpage code (in hex),
.IP
the byte offset that the field starts at (in decimal), the highest bit the field starts
at (0\-7), the width of the field in as a number of bits (decimal), and the value to set (hex or decimal)
A maximum of 64bits can be set at a time with this option.
.IP
2. The second format is a text file that contains all bytes of the mode page in hex. Each byte
.IP
must be separated by a space, new line, or underscore. It is recommended that this file
is created by copy\-pasting the output of the \fB\-\-showSCSIMP\fR option's default classic view, then modifying
after that.          Example use of the arguments:

Use this option to control the format of the output when displaying a SCSI mode page.
Modes:
.TP
classic \- This output is a classic output from old SCSI manuals where the bytes of
the page are output in a rows across the screen in hexadecimal format.
.TP
buffer
\- This output is a formatted buffer showing offsets on the top and side in hex.
.TP
This will output each row with up to 16 bytes of data before moving to the
next row.
