.IP
Use this option to set a specific field in a mode page to a
value. There are two argument formats to this option:
.IP
1. The first format expects a mode page (in hex), optionally a
subpage code (in hex), the byte offset that the field starts
at (in decimal), the highest bit the field starts at (0-7),
the width of the field in as a number of bits (decimal), and
the value to set (hex or decimal).  A maximum of 64bits can
be set at a time with this option.
.br
2. The second format is a text file that contains all bytes of
the mode page in hex. Each byte must be separated by a
space, new line, or underscore. It is recommended that this
file is created by copy-pasting the output of the
\fB\-\-showSCSIMP\fR  option's default classic view, then modifying
after that.
.IP
Example use of the arguments:
.br
1. Setting WCE to zero on Caching MP 8 from command line:
.br
command line: 08:2:2:1=0
