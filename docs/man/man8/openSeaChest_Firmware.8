Utility Arguments
=================
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR [deviceHandle | all]
.IP
Use this option with most commands to specify the device
handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
"all" argument instead of a device handle.
Example: \fB\-d\fR all
NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
.TP
specified options on each drive detected in the
OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
use a script opening a separate instance for each
device handle.
.HP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-scanFlags\fR [option list]
.IP
Use this option to control the output from scan with the
options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
.TP
ata \- show only ATA (SATA) devices
usb \- show only USB devices
scsi \- show only SCSI (SAS) devices
nvme \- show only NVMe devices
interfaceATA \- show devices on an ATA interface
interfaceUSB \- show devices on a USB interface
interfaceSCSI \- show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface
sd \- show sd device handles
sgtosd \- show the sd and sg device handle mapping
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-deviceInfo\fR
.IP
Show information and features for the storage device
.HP
\fB\-\-llInfo\fR
.IP
Dump low\-level information about the device to assist with debugging.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-scan\fR
.IP
Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.
.HP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-Scan\fR
.IP
This option is the same as \fB\-\-scan\fR or \fB\-s\fR,
however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
power states and may cause the OS to re\-enumerate them.
Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
a normal scan.
NOTE: A low\-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
all OSs. The low\-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.
.HP
\fB\-\-SATInfo\fR
.IP
Displays SATA device information on any interface
using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
reported data.
.HP
\fB\-\-testUnitReady\fR
.IP
Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
is available.
.HP
\fB\-\-fastDiscovery\fR
.TP
Use this option
to issue a fast scan on the specified drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-activateFW\fR
.IP
Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
immediately activate the new code on the drive.
You can use this along with a \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR & \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR to
automatically issue the activate command after the download has
completed.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware activation may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-downloadFW\fR [firmware_filename]
.IP
Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
device manufacturer authorized firmware data files which are designated
for the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may
harm a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without
spaces) if the firmware data file is in a different location.
This option will use segmented download by default. Use the
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR option to specify a different download mode.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces
for devices with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-downloadMode\fR [ auto | full | segmented | deferred | deferred+activate ]
.IP
Use this option along with the \fB\-\-downloadFW\fR option
to set the firmware download mode.
Supported Modes:
.TP
auto \- automatically determines the best mode to use to
perform the firmware update.
.TP
full \- performs a download in one large
transfer to the device.
.TP
segmented \- downloads the firmware in multiple
segments to the device. (Most compatible)
.TP
deferred \- performs a segmented download to the
device, but does not activate the new
firmware until a powercycle or activate
command is sent.
.TP
deferred+activate \- performs a deferred download and
automatically acitvates it for you.
Similar to how a segmented download works
but uses a separate activate command. This
is the recommended mode that "auto" will
select when possible for maximum compatibility
with Windows 10 and later operating systems.
.TP
WARNING: Firmware Updates may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
.HP
\fB\-\-firmwareSlot\fR/\-\-fwBufferID slot#
.IP
Use this option to specify a firmware slot (NVMe) or a buffer ID (SCSI)
along with the \fB\-\-downloadMode\fR (SCSI) or \fB\-\-activateFW\fR (NVMe & SCSI) options.
If this option is not used, a value of zero will be used instead,
which means the drive will automatically select the slot number.
.HP
\fB\-\-fwdlInfo\fR
.IP
Use this option to show the firmware download support
information for a drive.
.HP
\fB\-\-showLockedRegions\fR
.IP
This option should only be used when performing firmware
updates on legacy products. What this does is it ignores
a failing error code from the OS on the final segment of a
firmware update, but this update is actually successful.
This is needed to workaround hardware or firmware limitations
that were present in some old products.
.HP
\fB\-\-fwdlSegSize\fR [segment size in 512B blocks]
.IP
Use this option to specify a segment size in 512B blocks
to use for a segmented or deferred download. This option
will not affect an immediate download (full buffer at once).
The default segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes
may be faster, however they may also be incompatible with
controllers or drivers in the system. Smaller values are
more likely to be compatible, but also slower.
Use this option if the default used by the tool is not
working correctly for firmware updates.
.TP
\fB\-\-switchFW\fR
(NVMe Only)
.IP
Use this option to switch to a different firmware slot on an
NVMe drive. You must specify a slot with the \fB\-\-firmwareSlot\fR option
or this will fail. The specified slot must already have a
valid firmware image in it as well.
.TP
WARNING: Switching firmware may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
with multiple logical units or namespaces.
