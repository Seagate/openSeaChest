                     that can be used in situations where super critical performance
                     is required at a loss of information about a drive's capabilities.
                     Help now has many more examples of the options in the tool.
                     Fixed a few bugs in scan and device discovery that could cause
                     a crash or the tool to list no devices found.
                     Added option to dump low-level info to assist with debugging.

                     Fixed SAT ATA security protocol use for issuing ATA security
                     commands. In some cases there could be a misinterpretation of
                     normal vs enhanced erase. Likely only affected some NVMe devices
                     that implemented this security protocol.
                     Added --zeroVerify option to check a drive is filled with zeroes.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".
                     Improved parsing of linux distro/release information from
                     /etc/os-release file.

                     days, hours, etc where days was being truncated.
                     Fixed error reading NVMe features in Windows for drive info.
                     Fixed SAS Date of manufacture in drive info.
                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.

                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
v3.4.1  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
                     Improved memory sanitization for provided ATA security password when
                     the software is done using the password to ensure it has been deleted
                     from memory.
