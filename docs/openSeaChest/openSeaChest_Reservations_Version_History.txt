===============
v0.0.3  01-May-2021  Initial release of openSeaChest_Reservations utility.
v0.2.1  01-May-2023  Nobanner, fast discovery, lowlevel info options added.
v0.3.0  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
v0.4.0  28-May-2025  Added support for low-level SCSI rescan in Linux when passing aggressive scan flag -S.
                     Refactor reading SCSI capacity code which may reduce total commands issued.
                     Refactored looking up supported SCSI commands with Report Supported operations codes and
                     legacy CmdDT bit in Inquiry which reduces total commands issued.
                     Source code level support for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonflyBSD now available.
                     More source code hardening implemented with new bounds checking functions from
                     opensea-common library (behave similar to Annex K in C11).
                     Fixed a bug in reading device information (-i) on USB devices causing the information to be
                     incomplete.
                     Fixed big endian system support for all devices, but especially for NVMe.
                     Fixed looking up SD to SG device handles in Linux.
                     Added new exit codes for Device Not Found when opening the handle and Device Busy when
                     attempting to open a handle.
                     Enhanced file security API to display recommended actions to modify directories to be 
                     compatible with security requirements when reading or writing a file.
                     Fixed a crash when reading/writing files located at / in unix-like systems.
                     Fixed exit code when -d all or --modelMatch are used but all devices are skipped so that 
                     the exit code is not set to 0 (success) when all the devices were skipped.
                     Fixed parsing some CLI options to allow empty units like previous versions.
v0.4.1  07-Jul-2025  Fixed a bug with scan not showing any output in specific circumstances where number of successfully
                     enumerated devices is equivalent to the number of unsuccessfully enumerated devices.
                     Fixed a check for reading correct mode page which may cause changing some SAS features to fail.
                     Disabled extra CSMI related device scan in Windows that can cause a hang on some chipsets.
                     Added some more legacy USB devices to list of known devices to support these better when they are used.
