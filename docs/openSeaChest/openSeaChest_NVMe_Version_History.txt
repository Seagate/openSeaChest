v1.1.0  19-Feb-2020  1_21_30 libraries add printing the USB VID/PID in the
                     device info; fix to sg helper to support large systems;
                     many changes in support of dual actuators (example:
                     warning that EPC settings affect multiple LUNs); overhaul
                     to USB device detection and support, incorporating a new
                     USB hacks and workarounds approach which uses a lookup
                     table listing various USB bridge VIDs/PIDs and their
                     specific issues; separate Seagate SAS SN and PCBA SN.
v1.1.1  13-Apr-2020  1_21_30 libraries, fix memory allocation during the scan
                     command.
v2.0.0  20-Nov-2020  Changed how scan-flags are parsed. CSMI rewrite and initial
                     Intel RST NVMe support added. Numerous code quality improvements
                     which fixed many potential bugs and memory leaks. Improved
                     support for openfabrics NVMe drivers. Changed permissions
                     detection to show warnings rather than errors. Removed obsolete
                     CSMI and SAT 12B CDB options. CSMI handles now show as csmi:?:?:?
                     Fixed a bug in generic NVMe log pull commands.
v2.0.0  12-Feb-2021  opensea-transport code pulled in compatiblity fixes for Intel RST
                     NVMe devices in configurations that are not RAID, but show up
                     as RAID in the low-level OS code.
v2.0.0  16-Jun-2021  Pulled in updates to opensea-libs which includes the following:
                     Minor USB compatibility improvements and more products added
                     to the list with their specific workarounds.
                     Updated NVMe compatibility for FreeBSD 11.
                     Support for detection and showing of concurrent positioning 
                     (new multi-actuator support from the standards).
v2.2.2  28-Feb-2023  Includes new --noBanner option and new fast discovery option
                     that can be used in situations where super critical performance
                     is required at a loss of information about a drive's capabilities.
                     Help now has many more examples of the options in the tool.
                     Fixed a few bugs in scan and device discovery that could cause
                     a crash or the tool to list no devices found.
                     Added option to dump low-level info to assist with debugging.
                     Added date of manufacture info to the -i output when available.
                     Fixed some big endian compatibility issues discovered on AIX.
                     Automatic firmware update mode implemented for a better user 
                     experience. This will do deferred download + activate for the best
                     experience if a product supports this option, otherwise it will
                     use segmented download. Also includes some options to override 
                     the default nvme firmware update behavior as needed in special
                     circumstances.
                     Added --logLength option to specify an expected number of bytes
                     when reading an NVMe log since it is not possible to determine
                     this for all logs, especially vendor unique log pages.
v2.2.2  27-Mar-2023  opensea-transport updated to fix CSMI scan duplicating devices 
                     found in certain scenarios.
v2.3.0  01-Dec-2023  Updated to newer opensea-libs to pull in low-level fixes.
                     Improved support for reading more NVMe feature info.
                     Added interpretted output for host memory buffer feature.
                     Fixed a bug pulling the Telemetry log.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".
                     Improved parsing of linux distro/release information from
                     /etc/os-release file.
                     Fixed a bug in byte swap string used to get ATA MN, SN, FW.
                     Fixed a bug in getting/reporting power on hours as years, 
                     days, hours, etc where days was being truncated.
                     Fixed error reading NVMe features in Windows for drive info.
                     Fixed SAS Date of manufacture in drive info.
                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.
                     Fixed possible segmentation fault when reading /etc/mtab in Linux.
                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
v2.4.0  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
                     Added showNVMPowerStates and listSupportedLogs options.
v3.0.0  28-May-2025  Added support for low-level SCSI rescan in Linux when passing aggressive scan flag -S.
                     Refactor reading SCSI capacity code which may reduce total commands issued.
                     Refactored looking up supported SCSI commands with Report Supported operations codes and
                     legacy CmdDT bit in Inquiry which reduces total commands issued.
                     Source code level support for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonflyBSD now available.
                     More source code hardening implemented with new bounds checking functions from
                     opensea-common library (behave similar to Annex K in C11).
                     Fixed a bug in reading device information (-i) on USB devices causing the information to be
                     incomplete.
                     Fixed big endian system support for all devices, but especially for NVMe.
                     Fixed looking up SD to SG device handles in Linux.
                     Added new exit codes for Device Not Found when opening the handle and Device Busy when
                     attempting to open a handle.
                     Enhanced file security API to display recommended actions to modify directories to be 
                     compatible with security requirements when reading or writing a file.
                     Fixed a crash when reading/writing files located at / in unix-like systems.
                     Fixed exit code when -d all or --modelMatch are used but all devices are skipped so that 
                     the exit code is not set to 0 (success) when all the devices were skipped.
                     Fixed parsing some CLI options to allow empty units like previous versions.
                     Changed pulling telemetry log to save to a file and allow up to data area 4.
