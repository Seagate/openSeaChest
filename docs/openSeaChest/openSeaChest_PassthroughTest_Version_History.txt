                     helper to support large systems; many changes in support
                     of dual actuators (example: warning that EPC settings
                     affect multiple LUNs); overhaul to USB device detection
                     and support, incorporating a new USB hacks and workarounds
                     approach which uses a lookup table listing various USB

                     /etc/os-release file.

                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
