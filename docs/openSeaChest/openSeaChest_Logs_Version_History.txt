                     printing the USB VID/PID in the device info; fix to sg
                     helper to support large systems; many changes in support

                     and support, incorporating a new USB hacks and workarounds

                     bridge VIDs/PIDs and their specific issues; separate
                     Seagate SAS SN and PCBA SN.
v1.2.1  13-Apr-2020  1_21_30 libraries, fix memory allocation during the scan
                     command.
v2.4.0  01-Dec-2023  Updated to newer opensea-libs to pull in low-level fixes.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".
                     Improved parsing of linux distro/release information from
                     /etc/os-release file.
                     Fixed a bug in byte swap string used to get ATA MN, SN, FW.
                     Fixed a bug in getting/reporting power on hours as years, 
                     days, hours, etc where days was being truncated.
                     Fixed error reading NVMe features in Windows for drive info.
                     Fixed SAS Date of manufacture in drive info.
                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.
                     Fixed possible segmentation fault when reading /etc/mtab in Linux.
                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
v2.5.0  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     Fixed bug in generating log file names which could sometimes come out
                     as (null) in the path.
                     All log files can only be saved in secure directories. Directories must be
                     owned by the user/root/admin and not write accessible by others.
                     This rule applies to all directories above the output directory as well.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
v2.6.0  28-May-2025  Added support for low-level SCSI rescan in Linux when passing aggressive scan flag -S.
                     Refactor reading SCSI capacity code which may reduce total commands issued.
                     Refactored looking up supported SCSI commands with Report Supported operations codes and
                     legacy CmdDT bit in Inquiry which reduces total commands issued.
                     Source code level support for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonflyBSD now available.
                     More source code hardening implemented with new bounds checking functions from
                     opensea-common library (behave similar to Annex K in C11).
                     Fixed a bug in reading device information (-i) on USB devices causing the information to be
                     incomplete.
                     Fixed big endian system support for all devices, but especially for NVMe.
                     Fixed looking up SD to SG device handles in Linux.
                     Added new exit codes for Device Not Found when opening the handle and Device Busy when
                     attempting to open a handle.
                     Enhanced file security API to display recommended actions to modify directories to be 
                     compatible with security requirements when reading or writing a file.
                     Fixed a crash when reading/writing files located at / in unix-like systems.
                     Fixed exit code when -d all or --modelMatch are used but all devices are skipped so that 
                     the exit code is not set to 0 (success) when all the devices were skipped.
                     Fixed parsing some CLI options to allow empty units like previous versions.
v2.6.2  07-Jul-2025  Fixed a bug with scan not showing any output in specific circumstances where number of successfully
                     enumerated devices is equivalent to the number of unsuccessfully enumerated devices.
                     Added new exit code for when paths are detected as insecure to be resolved by the user before
                     files will be accessed in these directories (see https://github.com/Seagate/openSeaChest/wiki/Secure-File-And-Path).
                     Fixed a check for reading correct mode page which may cause changing some SAS features to fail.
                     Disabled extra CSMI related device scan in Windows that can cause a hang on some chipsets.
                     Added some more legacy USB devices to list of known devices to support these better when they are used.
