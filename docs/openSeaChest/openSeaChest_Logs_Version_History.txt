                     Windows, improved fast format support detection, and
                     refactored verbose output for NVMe commands.
v1.2.0  04-Feb-2020  1_21_30 libraries add in check for Elevated Privileges
                     (sudo, run as administrator) before trying to talk to
                     devices, new exit code 9 if privileges are missing;
                     printing the USB VID/PID in the device info; fix to sg
                     helper to support large systems; many changes in support
                     of dual actuators (example: warning that EPC settings
                     affect multiple LUNs); overhaul to USB device detection
                     and support, incorporating a new USB hacks and workarounds
                     approach which uses a lookup table listing various USB
                     bridge VIDs/PIDs and their specific issues; separate
                     Seagate SAS SN and PCBA SN.
v1.2.1  13-Apr-2020  1_21_30 libraries, fix memory allocation during the scan
                     command.
v2.4.0  01-Dec-2023  Updated to newer opensea-libs to pull in low-level fixes.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".
                     Improved parsing of linux distro/release information from
                     /etc/os-release file.
                     Fixed a bug in byte swap string used to get ATA MN, SN, FW.
                     Fixed a bug in getting/reporting power on hours as years, 
                     days, hours, etc where days was being truncated.
                     Fixed error reading NVMe features in Windows for drive info.
                     Fixed SAS Date of manufacture in drive info.
                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.
                     Fixed possible segmentation fault when reading /etc/mtab in Linux.
                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
v2.5.0  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     Fixed bug in generating log file names which could sometimes come out
                     as (null) in the path.
                     All log files can only be saved in secure directories. Directories must be
                     owned by the user/root/admin and not write accessible by others.
                     This rule applies to all directories above the output directory as well.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
