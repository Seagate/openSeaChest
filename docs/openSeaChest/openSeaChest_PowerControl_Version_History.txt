                     Seagate SAS SN and PCBA SN.

                     v2 is a significant overhaul of the tool:
                     These old v1 commands are retired:
                     --active,--changePower, --defaultMode, --disableMode,
                     --enableMode, --idle, --idleUnload, --powerMode
                     [powermode], --sleep, --standby, --modeTimer [timer value
                     in milliseconds], --transitionPower.

                     And transitioned to these new v2 commands: --idle [ enable
                     | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ], --idle_a [
                     enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ],
                     --idle_b [ enable | disable | default |
                     timerValueMilliseconds ], --idle_c [ enable | disable |
                     default | timerValueMilliseconds ], --standby_y [ enable |
                     disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ], --standby_z
                     [ enable | disable | default | timerValueMilliseconds ],
                     --standby [ enable | disable | default |
                     timerValueMilliseconds ] (Some settings are SAS only),
                     --transitionPower [active | idle | idleUnload | standby |
                     idle_a | idle_b | idle_c | standby_y | standby_z | sleep]

                     These v2 commands are new: --powerMeasurementMode [all | 5
                     | 12], --requestPowerMeasurement [seconds to perform
                     measurement], --showPowerTelemetry, --sasPhy [phy number]
                     (SAS Only), --sasPhyPartial [info | enable | disable] (SAS
                     Only), --sasPhySlumber [info | enable | disable] (SAS
                     Only), --transitionPowerState [new power state]

                     detection to show warnings rather than errors. Removed obsolete
                     CSMI and SAT 12B CDB options. CSMI handles now show as csmi:?:?:?
                     Fixed a bug where changing SATA EPC settings only updated idle_a
v3.0.1  12-Feb-2021  Improved argument parsing to accept hex in addition to decimal for
                     many different options.

v3.3.1  28-Feb-2023  Includes new --noBanner option and new fast discovery option
                     that can be used in situations where super critical performance
                     is required at a loss of information about a drive's capabilities.
                     Help now has many more examples of the options in the tool.
                     Fixed a few bugs in scan and device discovery that could cause
                     a crash or the tool to list no devices found.
                     Added option to dump low-level info to assist with debugging.

                     /etc/os-release file.
                     Fixed a bug in byte swap string used to get ATA MN, SN, FW.
                     Fixed a bug in getting/reporting power on hours as years, 
                     days, hours, etc where days was being truncated.
                     Fixed error reading NVMe features in Windows for drive info.

                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.
