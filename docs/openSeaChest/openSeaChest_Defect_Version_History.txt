===============
v0.9.0  28-Aug-2024  Combined 2 internal tools and moved them to openSeaChest_Defect
                     Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)            
v1.0.0  28-May-2025  Added support for low-level SCSI rescan in Linux when passing aggressive scan flag -S.
                     Refactor reading SCSI capacity code which may reduce total commands issued.
                     Refactored looking up supported SCSI commands with Report Supported operations codes and
                     legacy CmdDT bit in Inquiry which reduces total commands issued.
                     Source code level support for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonflyBSD now available.
                     More source code hardening implemented with new bounds checking functions from
                     opensea-common library (behave similar to Annex K in C11).
                     Fixed a bug in reading device information (-i) on USB devices causing the information to be
                     incomplete.
                     Fixed big endian system support for all devices, but especially for NVMe.
                     Fixed looking up SD to SG device handles in Linux.
                     Added new exit codes for Device Not Found when opening the handle and Device Busy when
                     attempting to open a handle.
                     Enhanced file security API to display recommended actions to modify directories to be 
                     compatible with security requirements when reading or writing a file.
                     Fixed a crash when reading/writing files located at / in unix-like systems.
                     Fixed exit code when -d all or --modelMatch are used but all devices are skipped so that 
                     the exit code is not set to 0 (success) when all the devices were skipped.
                     Implemented a workaround for old drives that support both read long/write long and the
                     write uncorrectable ext commands, but fail write uncorrectable to retry as needed.
