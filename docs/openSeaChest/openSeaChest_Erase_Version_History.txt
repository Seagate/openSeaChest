                     releases. Supported in this version, but will be moved in the future.
                     Removed Trim/Unmap from supported erase methods and quickest erase
                     since these are "hints" that may cause an erase, but are not guaranteed.
v3.0.3  12-Feb-2021  Improved argument parsing to accept hex in addition to decimal for
                     many different options.
                     Marking depopulate & getPhysicalElement status options as obsolete
                     as they have been migrated to SeaChest_Format.

                     More messages are now displayed warning not to interrupt format/fast
                     format operations and depopulate.
                     opensea-transport code pulled in enhancements to attempt to block
                     other applications and the OS from interrupting format, fast format,
                     depopulate, and ATA security erase to prevent potential problems
                     during these operations or which may leave the drive in a bad state
                     if they are interrupted.
v3.1.0  27-Apr-2021  SATA write same automatically implied poll since progress checks

v4.1.0  28-Feb-2023  Includes new --noBanner option and new fast discovery option
                     that can be used in situations where super critical performance
                     is required at a loss of information about a drive's capabilities.
                     Help now has many more examples of the options in the tool.
                     Added nvm format to list of options to do user secure erase. This
                     has also been pulled into the performQuickestErase option.
                     Fixed error in parsing --psid option causing it to report it was
                     always missing.

                     into account HPA, DCO, and AMAC features on ATA drives ahead of erasure.
                     Added --zeroVerify option to check a drive is filled with zeroes.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".

                     read commands to suggest a user also perform a overwrite.
                     Added --znr (Zone no reset) and --noDeallocate options for ZBDs and NVMe
                     devices with Sanitize and ATA security erase to allow for better erase
                     verification.
                     Added options to specify number of overwrite passes in Sanitize overwrite
                     as well as option to invert the patter between overwrite passes.
                     Added option to allow running sanitize in unrestricted mode.
                     Better handling for sanitize if in a failure condition to continue/retry a
                     sanitize operation in failed state instead of exiting.
                     Changed refresh FS system behavior to only run when utility knows erase fully completed
                     Added ability to manually refresh file systems from cli option.
                     Improved sanitization of ATA security erase password after it is done being
                     used to make sure it is also removed from memory.
                     Improved logic within --eraseRestoreMaxPrep to handle a few other cases and
                     feature set interactions that were not previously handled.
v4.7.1  28-May-2025  Added support for low-level SCSI rescan in Linux when passing aggressive scan flag -S.
                     Refactor reading SCSI capacity code which may reduce total commands issued.
                     Refactored looking up supported SCSI commands with Report Supported operations codes and
                     legacy CmdDT bit in Inquiry which reduces total commands issued.
                     Source code level support for OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonflyBSD now available.
                     More source code hardening implemented with new bounds checking functions from
                     opensea-common library (behave similar to Annex K in C11).
                     Fixed a bug in reading device information (-i) on USB devices causing the information to be
                     incomplete.
                     Fixed big endian system support for all devices, but especially for NVMe.
                     Fixed looking up SD to SG device handles in Linux.
                     Added new exit codes for Device Not Found when opening the handle and Device Busy when
                     attempting to open a handle.
                     Enhanced file security API to display recommended actions to modify directories to be 
                     compatible with security requirements when reading or writing a file.
                     Fixed a crash when reading/writing files located at / in unix-like systems.
                     Fixed exit code when -d all or --modelMatch are used but all devices are skipped so that 
                     the exit code is not set to 0 (success) when all the devices were skipped.
                     Added additional logic to --performQuickestErase so that it can handle when certain commands
                     are not allowed on a given adapter or OS to choose a different option.
                     Fixed a logic error with TRIM/Deallocate commands to NVMe devices in Windows.
v4.7.3  07-Jul-2025  Fixed a bug with scan not showing any output in specific circumstances where number of successfully
                     enumerated devices is equivalent to the number of unsuccessfully enumerated devices.
                     Added new exit code for when paths are detected as insecure to be resolved by the user before
                     files will be accessed in these directories (see https://github.com/Seagate/openSeaChest/wiki/Secure-File-And-Path).
                     Fixed a check for reading correct mode page which may cause changing some SAS features to fail.
                     Disabled extra CSMI related device scan in Windows that can cause a hang on some chipsets.
                     Added some more legacy USB devices to list of known devices to support these better when they are used.
                     Fixed detection of supported sanitize operations on SAS drives that may not support the AUSE mode.
