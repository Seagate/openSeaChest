                     Automatic firmware update mode implemented for a better user 
                     experience. This will do deferred download + activate for the best
                     experience if a product supports this option, otherwise it will
                     use segmented download. Also includes some options to override

                     Fixed compatibility issue with PMC 8070 by using segmented
                     download instead of deferred download by default.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".

                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.

                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
v4.2.0  28-Aug-2024  Pull in security updates and low-level bug fixes from opensea-libs.
                     CISS RAID device support for Linux (CCISS, HPSA, and SmartPQI drivers)
                     All firmware files must now be loaded from secured directories.
                     Secured directories are owned by the user or root and do not allow writing to other users/groups.
                     Fixed incorrect parameter for activate option. Backwards compatibility in 
                     the API was able to catch this without causing an error.
                     Added show SCSI FW info option which is based on Seagate's public
                     SCSI commands reference manual and show more fields unique to Seagate firmware.
