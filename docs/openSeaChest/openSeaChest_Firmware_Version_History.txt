                     experience. This will do deferred download + activate for the best
                     experience if a product supports this option, otherwise it will
                     use segmented download. Also includes some options to override

                     Fixed compatibility issue with PMC 8070 by using segmented
                     download instead of deferred download by default.
                     New config file that uses json instead of old proprietary config
                     file.
                     Stopped reading /etc/passwd file to show username in banner.
                     Banner will now show either "admin"/"root" or "current user".
                     Improved parsing of linux distro/release information from
                     /etc/os-release file.

                     Fixed SAS Date of manufacture in drive info.
                     Added detection of HPA security feature.
                     Added more SMART attributes definitions for Seagate HDDs & SSDs,
                     and more definitions for Maxtor HDDs.
                     Improved temperature detection from older HDDs with only
                     SMART attribute 194 reporting current temperature.
                     Added separate warning for SMART attributes below threshold that
                     are not considered prefail/warranty attributes (aka failures).
                     Fixed output of Seagate Airflow temperature SMART attribute.
                     Added showing new capacity after changing Max LBA.

                     Workaround for some SAS drives on some HBAs reporting incorrect
                     response to SAT A1h CDB.
                     Fixed a bug in FreeBSD causing non-data ATA commands to report
                     all zeroes instead of expected output in RTFRs.
